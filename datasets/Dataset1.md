## 2.2

## The Capital Works Management Framework

The Capital  Works  Management  Framework is a  series  of  documents  which collectively describe the operating environment, procedures and processes to be followed for the delivery of capital works projects.  It incorporates contractual provisions, guidance material and technical procedures covering the public works project lifecycle from inception to final project delivery and review.

The aim of the Capital Works Management Framework is to ensure that there is an integrated methodology and a consistent approach to the planning, management and delivery of public capital works projects with the objectives of greater cost certainty, better value for money and more efficient project delivery.  The flow chart below describes the framework.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Participants  should  refer  to  the  separate  Guidance  Notes  prepared  by  the GCCC as part of the Capital Works Management Framework, including:

-  Project Management Structure
-  Project Definition
-  Budget Development
-  Procurement Strategy and Contract Type
- -Guidance Notes for Public Works Contracts
- -Public Works Contracts (5)
- -Arbitration Rules
- -Model Forms
-  Consultants Appointment  Process  and  Conditions  of Engagement  for Construction Consultants
- -Procurement Guidance Notes
- -Suitability Assessment of Consultants for Category 12 Services for Both
- Open and Restricted Procedures
- -Standard Conditions of Engagement for Construction Consultants
-  Design Development and Procurement Process
- -Design Process
- -Suitability Assessment  of  Works  Contractors  for  Both  Open  and Restricted Procedures
- -Procurement Guidance Notes
-  Design Cost Control Procedures
-  Tender Process
- -Template Public Works Tender Document
-  Construction Process
-  Construction Cost Control
-  Project Review
-  Analysis of Outturn Costs
- 2.3 The Background

Public capital works projects generally fall into two sectoral classifications:

-  Civil Engineering Works;
-  Building Works.

This division reflects some fundamental differences between the civil engineering and building sectors.

Civil engineering works such as roads, tunnels, bridges etc. are designed by Civil Engineers  acting  [for  the  most  part]  under  the  direction  of  the  Contracting Authority and are carried out by civil engineering contractors.

<!-- image -->

Building  works  such  as  office  buildings,  schools  and  hospitals  are  designed  by Architects  (with  other  consultants)  again  acting  [for  the  most  part]  under  the direction of the Contracting Authority and are constructed by building contractors.

In  both  sectors  the  standard  forms  of  contract  used  in  the  past  have  been published  by  the  lead  professionals'  professional  institutions.    In  the  case  of building works by the RIAI with the agreement of the Department of Finance, in the case of civil engineering works by the IEI, now Engineers Ireland.

A number of contracting authorities have also used the various FIDIC and JCT forms suitably amended for use in Ireland.

The  old  forms  have  not  served  the  Public  Sector  well  in  the  past,  hence  the introduction of the new forms which:

-  Reflect the latest thinking in project and risk management;
-  Are clear in terms of wording and in the allocation of risk;
-  Recognise  the  development  of  new  procurement  methods  such  as  design and build;
-  Support the certainty of outcome in terms of cost, quality and programme that an effective capital asset delivery process demands.

In the private sector it now common practice for the equivalent private sector forms, mainly the RIAI Form, to be heavily amended by clients' solicitors with the objective maximising financial certainty by risk allocation.

Contracts  1  and  3  above  replace  previously  used  employer  designed  standard forms and throughout this manual are referred to as the Traditional Contracts.

Contracts  2  and  4  are  new  forms  for  works  designed  by  the  contractor  and throughout this manual are referred to as Design and Build Contracts.

Contract 5 above has been developed to both share and reduce the level of risk transfer to small/medium sized contractors for projects of value less than €5m.

The new contracts are currently available at the free of charge following links:

http://www.finance.gov.ie/ViewDoc.asp?fn=/documents/publications/other/construct reformdec06.htm&amp;CatID=61&amp;m=p

## http://www.e-tenders.gov.ie/guides/guides\_list.aspx?type=2

On 19 May 2007 a charging mechanism will be introduced for the forms.

Contracting Authorities - called "Employers" in the public works contracts - are now required  to  enter  into  fixed  price  lump  sum  contracts  for  public  works, tendered  on  a competitive basis, with appropriate risk allocated to the contractor.  This  new  arrangement  will  result  in  greater  cost  certainty,  better value for money and more efficient delivery of public capital projects. This risk allocation  is facilitated by  the  Contracting  Authority  providing  appropriate information in the tender documents for the tenderers to assess and price. The information to be supplied will depend on the type of contract being used.

The  new  forms  of  construction  contracts  must  be  applied  to  traditional  and design  and  build  public  works  in  Ireland  that  are  procured  directly  by  a government  department,  bodies  under  its  aegis,  including  local  authorities  or other  relevant  bodies  that  provide  public  services  (e.g.  schools,  voluntary hospitals, etc).

The new forms of construction contracts are to be used without amendments. In this context, the new forms have been drafted in a way that better protects the public sector client's interest in order to achieve value for money outcomes from public expenditure on public works projects.  However, in exceptional and rare  circumstances,  consideration  can  be  given  to  amendments  to non  core

<!-- image -->

elements of the new forms of construction contracts.  The request for any such amendments from those bodies  required  to  use  the  new  contracts  should  be submitted to the GCCC for consideration and   approval as appropriate.  Other public  bodies  (such  as  commercial  semi-state  bodies)  wishing  to  use  the  new forms  of  construction  contracts  but  with  amendments,  should  also  submit  a request to the GCCC for consideration and approval as appropriate.

Where  the  body  procuring  the  public  works  project  is  not  a  government department or a body under its aegis or a local authority or other relevant body that  provides  public  services  (e.g.  schools,  voluntary  hospitals,  etc)  and  more than  50%  of  the  funding  for  the  project  comes  from  a  source  other  than  the Exchequer, the government department or relevant body, as appropriate, should decide if the new Public Works contracts will apply. If it is decided not to use the new forms of construction contracts on a particular public works project, the  Accounting  Officer/Accountable  Officer  in  the  government  department  or the relevant public body must be satisfied that the contract terms in the other contract being used are framed in a manner that seeks to protect public funds. They must also be satisfied that the alternative contract conditions include the provisions on Pay and Conditions of Employment (i.e. clause 5.3 in the new forms of construction contracts). The rationale for this decision should be documented in an appropriate and transparent manner.

Commercial semi-state bodies (e.g. ESB, BGE, An Post) are not required to use the new forms of construction contracts on public works projects unless more than 50% of the funding for the project concerned comes directly or indirectly from the Exchequer.

## 2.5 Timeline for Rollout

It is intended that the new forms of Construction Contracts for Public Works will apply as follows:

-  To all new public works projects about to begin the planning stage on or after Monday 19 February 2007.
-  To all new public works projects where planning has commenced but where detailed tender  documents  have  not  been  developed  by  Monday  19 February 2007.
-  For  those  public  works  projects  where  detailed  development  of  tender documents  has  commenced,  contracting  authorities  can  elect  to  use  the new forms of construction contracts on or after Monday 19 February 2007.
-  Where a contracting authority, following appropriate training, wants to use the new forms of construction contracts on or after Monday 19 February 2007.
-  Where a contracting authority, following appropriate training, wants to use the new forms of construction contracts on public works projects on a date earlier than Monday 19 February 2007.

Refer to Department of Finance Circular 33/2006 for further information.

## 2.6 The Government's Objectives

The introduction of the new forms of contract supports the Government's objectives to:

-  Move towards greater cost certainty at contract award stage and ensure as far as practicable that the accepted tender prices and the final cost are the same;
-  Award  contracts  on  the  basis  of  a  lump-sum  fixed-price  to  the  greatest extent  possible;
-  Rebalance risk so that there is optimal allocation of risk;
-  Achieve value for money; and
-  Achieve more efficient delivery of the projects.

## 2.7 The Aim of this Course

The  aim  of  this  course  is  to  support  deployment  of  the  new  forms  by introducing  them  to  selected  front  line  officers  and  to  enable  them  share  this knowledge with those officers yet to be trained to roll out use of the forms on the projects for which they are responsible.

Having completed the course, participants should have:

-  An appreciation of the Capital Works Management Framework;
-  An understanding of the key differences between the new forms and those previously in use in their sectors;
-  An understanding of the principles of risk assessment and appropriate risk allocation;
-  An  understanding  of  how  the  new  conditions  of  conditions  can  allocate risks;
-  An understanding of the impact of the forms on the procurement process;
-  An  understanding  of  the  duties  and  obligations  of  the  parties  under  the forms;
-  An understanding of how to successfully employ the new forms to achieve the overriding objectives of:
- -Cost Certainty;
- -Value for money; and
- -Cost effective project delivery.

## 2.8 The New Contracts as Enablers for Better Management

The new public works contracts are very much aligned with established project management processes and their use will contribute to the effective management of Capital Works Projects.

-  The  contracts  are  legal  documents  written  in  ordinary  language  and  are designed  to  be  easily  understood,  applied  and  interpreted  by  employers, contractors and design teams;
-  The  contracts  are  arranged  and  organised  in  a  structure  which  helps  the user gain familiarity with their contents;
-  The  actions  by  the  parties  are  defined  precisely  so  there  should  be  few disputes about who is to do what and when;
-  Change control processes are streamlined with reasonable certainty as to their outcome;
-  Early warning procedures are built in for dealing with circumstances causing delay and additional cost;
-  Such circumstances which confer entitlements to additional time and money on  the  contractor  are  called  Delay  Events  and  Compensation  Events respectively  and  all  are  neatly  captured  in  two  adjoining  sections  -  this contrasts  with  say  the  old  forms  of  contract  where  such  clauses  are dispersed throughout the conditions;
-  Issues relating to assessment of Delay and Compensation Events are to be resolved as projects proceed.

The new forms will promote best practice in project implementation by employers, design teams and contractors with:

-  Better pre-construction planning of projects;
-  Promotion of completeness of design prior to construction;
-  Consideration  at  the  outset  of  risk  issues  such  as  ground  conditions, archaeology;
-  Clear and decisive allocation of risk to drive accountability and motivate the parties to actively contribute to project success;
-  More collaborative working between employers, design teams and contractors over the life of the project;
-  Proactive cooperative management of the interactions between the parties which will reduce the risk of time and cost over runs associated with capital projects.

<!-- image -->

## 3. The New Contracts - Main Features

## 3.1 Structure of the Contract

The new public works contracts comprise the following elements regardless of whether building or civil engineering, traditional or design and build:

-  A Letter of Acceptance issued by the Employer accepting the Contractor's successful tender. This should refer to and include any tender clarifications.    The  issue  of  the  Letter  of  Acceptance  creates  a  binding contract.
-  The Agreement between the Employer and the Contractor. This identifies the  date  the  contract  is  entered  into,  the  parties  to  the  contract,  the contract sum and any post tender clarifications.
-  The Contract Conditions which set out the roles and responsibilities of the  parties  and  the  operational  and  management  issues  which  will  govern the  provision  of  the  Works.  This  is  subdivided  into  thirteen  sections  as follows:
- a. The Contract
- b. The Law
- c. Loss, Damage and Injury
- d. Management
- e. Contractor's Personnel
- f. Property
- g. The Site
- h. Quality Testing and Defects
- i. Time and Completion
- j. Claims and Adjustments
- k. Payment
- l. Termination
- m. Disputes
-  The Schedule containing  contract-specific  information  referred  to  in  the conditions but with substantially more information. This is the equivalent of the Appendix in the GDLA and Appendix to Tender in the IEI 3 rd Edition. The Contracting Authority completes Part 1 and includes it in the tender documents when inviting tenders. Part 2 consists of information filled in by the  Contractor  and  submitted  with  its  tender.  The  completed  Schedule should be appended to the Letter of Acceptance.
-  The Works  Requirements . For  a  traditional  contract  this  includes completed  drawings,  specifications,  site  investigation  and  other  relevant reports, consents, preliminary safety and health plan, etc.   For a design and

<!-- image -->

build contract this would comprise performance or output based specifications as well as any developed design together with site investigation or other reports, such relevant consents as have been obtained, the preliminary safety and health plan etc.

-  The Pricing Document identified  in  the  schedule  and  completed  by  the Contractor including the bill of quantities (if any), pricing schedules, contract sum analysis and/or other documents in which the Contractor provides its detailed pricing proposals.
-  The Works Proposals state  how the Contractor proposes to carry out the  works.    When  the  Contractor  has  design  responsibility  the  Works Proposals include the Contractor's design.
-  A suite of model forms for use during procurement and administration of the contract comprising:
- a. Form of Tender (F1)
- b. Form of Bid Bond (F2)
- c. Form of Letter to Apparently Unsuccessful Tenderer (F3)
- d. Form of Letter of Intent (F4)
- e. Form of Letter of Acceptance  (F5)
- f. Form of Performance Bond (F6)
- g. Form of Parent Company Guarantee (F7)
- h. Form of Novation and Guarantee Deed (F8)
- i. Form of Appointment of Project Supervisor for Construction Stage Only (F9)
- j. Form of Appointment of Project Supervisor for Construction Stage and Design Process (F10)
- k. Form of Appointment of Project Supervisor for Design Process Only (F11)
- l. Form of Professional Indemnity Certificate (F12)
- m. Form of Collateral Warranty (F13)
- n. Form of Novation (F14)
- o. Form of Rates and Conditions of Employment Certificate (F15)
- p. Form of Bond - Unfixed Works Items (F16)
- q. Form of Retention Bond (F17)
- r. Form of Conciliator's Agreement (F18)
- s. Form of Bond - Conciliator's Recommendation (F19)

- h. There is provision for professional indemnity insurance;
- i. There are detailed provisions dealing with management of the Works, planning the Works, value engineering, communications, meetings, etc;
- j. There is provision for Collateral Warranties;
- k. Certain risks can be allocated between the parties;
- l. There is provision to build into the contract period and contract sum for delays that entitle the Contractor to extensions of time and additional monies in a new concept called programme contingency this is not to be confused with contractor's float time;
- m. Costs associated with delays which confer additional financial entitlements on the Contractor can be tendered:
- n. Tenders are evaluated on the basis of the proposed contract sum and on delay costs;
- o. There is provision for termination of the contract at the Employer's election;
- p. The contracts effectively provide for exclusive remedies;
- q. Disputes can be referred to conciliation and arbitration.

## 4. Risk Management

## 4.1 What is Risk?

An uncertain event or set of characteristics that, should it occur, will have an effect on the achievement of one or more of the project's objectives …….

Association of Project Managers

An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on at least one project objective such as time, cost, scope or quality …… PMBoK ®

Risk is the likelihood of variation in the occurrence of an event, which may have either positive or negative consequences.….

RAMP Institution of Civil Engineers &amp; Faculty of Actuaries and Institute of Actuaries

## 4.2 The Broader Context

Construction and engineering projects are risky ventures:

40% are late

50% over budget

30% fail to meet expectations of users

[Rethinking Construction UK DTI, 1998]

There are probably no similar statistics for Irish project outcomes.

However, Irish construction and engineering projects face the same risk pressures:

-  Each project is unique;
-  Site conditions and constraints are highly variable;
-  The project teams of Contracting Authority, Design Team and Contractor most  likely  will  change  from  project  to  project,  so  lessons  learned  are difficult to capture;
-  Projects can take a long time from inception to completion and people can move on;
-  There are often competing pressures of time and budget;
-  The  construction  market  is  cyclical,  subject  to  upswings  and  downswings with consequent pressures on resources.

<!-- image -->

## The risks that construction and engineering projects face are manifold and can be classified under three headings:

| Business Case            | Project Delivery   | Operational        |
|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Right Project            | Safety             | Owner Expectations |
| Right Location           | Quality            | Future Expansion   |
| Interest Rates           | Cost               | Obsolescence       |
| Legislative              | Time               | Maintenance        |
| Demand/Availability Risk |                    | Availability       |
| Market                   |                    | Whole Life Costs   |
|                          |                    | Defects            |

The potential project delivery risks issues which can impact on time, cost and quality on a project include incomplete or late project information, changes, ground conditions, archaeology, bad weather, defects, inability to secure labour and materials, etc.   Typically these risks are allocated between the Employer and Contractor by the conditions of contract.  Obviously if such risks are effectively managed at the outset their impact on project delivery can be effectively reduced.

## 4.3 Risk Management Processes Generally

A risk management approach which is based solely on past experience and dependent on judgement may work reasonably well in a stable low risk environment but is unlikely to be effective for major projects.

Risk management is a structured approach to identifying, assessing and controlling risks that emerge during the course of the project.  Its purpose is to support better decision-making through understanding the risks inherent in a project and their likely impact.  The benefits of formal risk management are:

-  It focuses the team on managing risk effectively by directly addressing issues that threaten project success;
-  Confidence in the project outcome is increased;
-  It  provides  a  mechanism  for  reporting  risk  on  a  regular  basis  to  senior management and escalating severe risk issues to appropriate levels; and
-  Projects  can  be  considered  on  the  basis  that  risks  will  be  considered rationally.

<!-- image -->

There are various published methodologies and software packages for risk management and the detail of these is outside of the scope of this course, however, a generic risk management process will usually involve the following stages:

-  Identification;
-  Analysis;
-  Evaluation;
-  Risk treatment;
-  Reporting.

For each risk (other than those designated as negligible) the following treatment options are available:

-  Reducing or eliminating the risk;
-  Transferring the risk via the contract;
-  Transferring the risk by insuring for it;
-  Accepting the risk and managing it;
-  Obtaining better information to reduce the uncertainty.

## Example:

## Reducing/Eliminating Risk

It is understood that there may be contaminated soil on the site of a proposed project but there is no conclusive data on this matter.  If the risk of this was to materialise during construction it would cause significant delay and a cost overrun, the effects of which would be greater than the actual cost of dealing with it in advance.

## The options available are:

- (i) Ignore it and deal with it if and when it arises during the construction;
- (ii) Determine the full extent of the contaminated material and the nature and toxicity of the contaminant by means of investigatory studies.  The material can then be dealt with (a) in an enabling works contract or (b) in the main contract.

A decision is made to determine the full extent of the contaminated material and the nature and toxicity of the contaminant by means of investigatory studies.   The contaminated soil is then removed in an enabling works contract.  In this instance better information was obtained to reduce the uncertainty and the potential risk to the main project was dealt with by having an enabling works contract.

<!-- image -->

## Example:

## Allocating Risk via the Contract

A project involves extensive earthworks.  Considerable site investigation has been carried out and factual site investigation reports are available, indicating the likely nature of the ground, including the location of bearing strata and the type of strata encountered.  On the basis of these reports, the Engineer has designed the foundations.

## The options available are:

- (i) the Employer retains the risk of ground conditions;
- (ii) the risk be allocated to the Contractor.

On the basis of the extensive site investigations, the Engineer considers that the ground conditions likely to be encountered are quantifiable with a degree of certainty.  A decision is made that the Contractor should have responsibility for unforeseeable ground conditions.

In this instance it was considered that there was sufficient site investigation information available to enable the contractors assess and price the risk. Thus the risk was allocated to the Contractor.

## Example:

## Accepting the Risk and Managing It

An existing hospital wing is to be refurbished.  The refurbishment cannot commence until a new block is completed under another contract and the existing wing is decanted to this. If the Contractor is appointed for the refurbishment prior to the new block being completed there is a potential risk of delay to site possession for the refurbishment and consequent additional cost as a result.   The refurbishment project dates are adjusted to ensure there is no risk of delayed possession of the site for the refurbishment.

In this instance the risk was reduced and accepted.

Implementation of the decision to allocate a risk to the Contractor may involve a financial premium and may introduce different but acceptable risks. Thus, in taking a decision, consideration needs to be given to:

-  whether the risk can be effectively managed by the party allocated the risk or whether the allocation causes a different, but more damaging risk;
-  whether the intended allocation of risk is effective and enforceable; and
-  does the risk allocation represent value for money?
- 4.4 Commercial Context (Value for Money)

The governing principle is that risks should be allocated to whichever party is best placed to manage them. The optimal allocation of risk, rather than maximising risk transfer, is the objective and careful balance is required in this regard. Accordingly, the degree to which risk should be allocated to a contractor depends on an assessment of each risk on a case by case basis.

<!-- image -->

Successful allocation of risk requires a clear understanding by the contracting authority of the risks presented by a project, the broad impact that these risks may have on the attractiveness of a project to tenderers and on costs, and the limits to which a particular risk allocation might still be considered for value for money.

## 5 Risk Allocation,

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## 5. Risk Allocation, What is New?

## 5.1 Introduction

The new forms of contract deal with risk allocation in two distinct ways:

-  By offering a choice of procurement strategy;
-  Within the conditions, by the allocation of risk and responsibility for certain matters

## 5.2 Selection of the Procurement Strategy

The  Selection  of  the  most  appropriate  form  of  contract  for  the  project  is covered by the Guidance Note Procurement Strategy and Contract Type.

In the selection of the procurement strategy for the project such as Traditional or Design and Build, the Contracting Authority is making an important decision on the allocation of the risk for design responsibility.

The Traditional contracts require that design information upon which tenders are sought will be comprehensively developed and the Contracting Authority retains responsibility and risk for:

-  Design of the works;
-  Completeness of the design of the works;
-  Changes to the design of the works.

Under the Design and Build contracts it is the Contractor who has responsibility for:

-  Design of the works;
-  Completeness of the design of the works;
-  Changes to the design of the works.

However the Contracting Authority retains risk associated with any changes to the Works Requirements.

There are particular projects that are not suited to the use of design-and-build contracts - these include certain major alteration or refurbishment projects and most maintenance projects.

Contracting Authorities should be aware that the tender evaluation and award process for design-and-build contracts is more complex than for traditional contracts. This increased complexity gives rise to greater risks regarding transparency and objectivity in determining the most acceptable submission in accordance with the award criteria

<!-- image -->

## 5.3 What is new in terms of risk allocation?

- 1. The new forms for traditional contracts contemplate that the design by the Employer's consultants will be comprehensively developed - the contracts do not provide for provisional sums or provisional quantities. thus there is a greater onus on contracting authorities to ensure completeness of design.
- 2. There is now an Irish standard form of contract for both building and civil engineering works under which the Contractor has responsibility and risk for design and completeness of design.
- 3. Contracts for the most part will be lump sum and the Contractors will own the "quantities risk", however Contracting Authorities can make a choice about the contractual status of the bill of quantities.
- 4. A new concept called Programme Contingency is introduced and Contractors are required to allow within the contract period and within the Contract Sum for a specified delay period, attributable to events which confer rights to extensions of time and financial compensation.
- 5. Risks associated with ground conditions, fossils, archaeology, human remains and utilities are now specifically referred to in the building contract; the GDLA form made no specific reference to these matters.
- 6. Employers can make choices at the time of tendering as to whether any of the following matters confer upon the Contractor the right to recover additional monies:
- a. Unforeseeable fossils, archaeology, human remains;
- b. Unforeseeable ground conditions [excepting under the Design &amp; Build Form];
- c. Unforeseeable utilities [excepting under the Design &amp; Build Form];
- d. Unforeseeable delays by utilities companies in relocating or disconnecting utilities.
- 7. Contractors can be required to submit at the time of tender their "all in" costs per day  for  events for which they are entitled to receive financial compensation.  This is  their only entitlement for such events and as such needs to be carefully estimated by contractors.
- 8. Force majeure and inability to secure labour and materials no longer entitles Contractors to extensions of time.
- 9. There are mandatory procedures and notice periods which must be strictly complied with by Contractors to receive extensions of time and additional financial compensation where such entitlements exist.
- 10. The Contractor now has responsibility for the design by Specialists [the new entity which replaces the nominated subcontractor/supplier];

<!-- image -->

- 11. The Contractor now owns the risk associated with appointing a replacement Specialist in the event that such is required as a result of default or insolvency of the Specialist.
- 12. Contracts are now effectively fixed price [except for hyperinflation and for very long durations - more of which later].

## 5.4 Delay and Compensation Events

At its most fundamental level [and subject to narrowly defined exceptions] the Contractor owns the commercial risk associated with providing the Works, in accordance with the Works Requirements, by the Date for Substantial Completion, for the Contract Sum.

The exceptions are those events that give rise to an entitlement to extensions to the Date for Substantial Completion which are termed Delay Events, and those events that alter the Contract Sum which are termed Compensation Events

Delay and Compensation Events are broadly defined in the Guidance Note as follows:

Delay events are events which, if they occur, are not at the Contractor's risk, and subject to the compliance with the contract, entitle the Contractor to an extension to the date for substantial completion of the works (and any affected section) equal to the amount of delay, taking into account only site working days.

Compensation events are events which, if they occur, are not at the Contractor's risk, and subject to the compliance with the contract, entitle the Contractor to be compensated for the effect the events have on the cost of the works.

The  new  conditions  allow  Contracting  Authorities  well  defined  choice  as  to whether  certain  events  are  Compensation  Events.  Moreover  through  a  new mechanism of programme contingency which is discussed in greater detail later, there  are  thresholds  [a  single  threshold  only  in  the  Minor  Works  Form]  that apply before delay costs associated with Compensation Events become payable by the Employer.

The Contractor's contractual financial entitlement for a Compensation Event is easily ascertainable since it can be requested to bid its delay cost per site working day at the time of tender.  This approach will promote resolution of issues on projects as they arise and thus less adversarial relationships allowing project teams to better direct their efforts at project delivery.

## 5.5 Comparison of Risk Allocation Under the Various Forms

The following  table  is  compiled  from  Section  K  of  the  Schedule  Part  1  of  the traditional, design and build and minor works forms.  It tabulates the permitted Delay and Compensation Events under the forms.  Where "Yes" is inserted in a box an event is a delay or compensation event as appropriate.  The converse applies where "No" is inserted.

The pre-completed boxes cannot be changed however, Contracting Authorities may select the risk allocation by inserting "Yes" or "No" in the boxes shaded yellow.

## 5.6

## How Should Contracting Authorities Allocate Risk?

Risk Nr 17 Differences between the Works Requirements and Bills of Quantities [Traditional Contracts Only]

## Risk Nr 18Unforeseeable items of archaeological interest or human remains found on the site

Risk Nr 19Unforeseeable ground conditions, man-made obstructions, [Traditional Contracts Only]

The  Guidance Note  for  Public  Works  Contract suggests  that  Employers should carefully consider the circumstances that warrant the use of Bills of Quantities. The policy is to have design developed so that "No" can be inserted in this box.  This requires comprehensively developed design documentation including, for example, completed reinforcement drawings and mechanical and electrical designs.

In  circumstances  where  ground  conditions  risk  [Risk  Nr  19]  is  being passed on to the Contractor in traditional contracts "No" should always be inserted.

Has the necessity for an archaeological report been determined and an appropriate preliminary archaeological report been prepared?

Contracting Authorities are strongly advised, where the works are to be located in archaeologically sensitive locations, at feasibility stage, to seek expert advice and make contact with the National Monuments Section (NMS)  of  the  Department  of  the  Environment,  Heritage  and  Local Government, which is responsible for the Identification and designation of sites through the Archaeology Survey of Ireland, if the works are to be located in archaeologically sensitive locations.  In the event that the works may affect  a  designated  site  or  area  of  archaeological  potential, Contracting  Authorities  should  take  account  of  the  NMS  Framework Document  on  the  Principles  for  the  Protection  of  the  Archaeological Heritage.    Where  the  NMS  requires  it,  a  preliminary  archaeological assessment  (including  site  investigation  if  considered  necessary)  should be undertaken.

Where  practical,  archaeological  risks  associated  with  sites  should  be resolved by way of advance contracts.

A  Contracting  Authority  should  allocate  archaeological  risk  to  the Contractor  when,  having  completed  a  preliminary  site  investigation  in compliance with the NMS  Framework,  the  Contracting  Authority decides that there is no risk, or that the risk can be easily assessed and priced.

Where excavations are required, the project should be subjected to a carefully designed, executed and accurately documented site investigations under a separate enabling work contract.

Contracting  Authorities  must  make  every  effort  to  ensure  that  the accuracy and adequacy of the information gathered is correct. All tests, descriptions and reporting procedures should be in accordance with the current relevant codes of practice and leave no room for ambiguity.  Site investigation  contractors  should  only  employ  trained  and  experienced operators and supervisory staff so as to ensure the quality and integrity of information. Contracting Authorities should consider employing their own experienced experts on site to monitor site investigation activities necessary for the duration of the site investigation works.

Factual  reports  on  the  findings  of  the  site  investigations  should  be included in tender documents.

It is important to stress that such information is given without warranty. Contracting Authorities should be careful as to how below ground design information is presented in the Works Requirements, particularly in relation to dimensions of depths, depths drawn to scale, pile lengths or datum levels or bearing strata to be reached arising out of an interpretation of site investigation material. To disclose such information in the Works Requirements could result in a claim for re-measurement if the actual information is different when the ground is opened up. A Contracting Authority should allocate the risk associated with unforeseeable ground conditions to the Contractor when, having completed a thorough site investigation, either decides that there is no risk, or that the risk can be easily assessed and priced by tenderers.   |

| Risk Nr 20- Unforeseeable utilities in the ground [Traditional Contracts Only]              | Surveys which will be carried out during the preconstruction should identify the location and nature of any utilities traversing the site. In carrying out these surveys particular care should be exercised on existing non Greenfield sites or on public roads to locate such utilities with a degree of certainty. Contracting Authorities should adopt a practical approach to the issue of utilities if possible dealing with them in enabling works contracts. Contracting Authorities should allocate the risk associated with unforeseeable utilities to the Contractor when, having completed a thorough site survey, the Contracting Authority either decides that there is no risk, or that the risk can be easily assessed and priced by tenderers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Risk Nr 21- Owners of Utilities fail to relocate or disconnect utilities in a timely manner | Contracting Authorities should adopt a practical approach to the issue of utilities. In some cases, a separate enabling works contract to relocate utilities in advance of the main contract may be advisable. A Contracting Authority should allocate the risk associated with relocation or disconnection of utilities to the Contractor when the Contracting Authority has agreed procedures with utilities owners as to their disconnection/relocation such that there is no risk, or that the risk can be easily assessed and priced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The overriding basis on which a Compensation Event risk is allocated to the Contractor should be that there is a low level of risk or that the Contractor is furnished with sufficient information to enable it assess and price the risk.

A project risk strategy that attempts to allocate all risk to a Contractor by indiscriminate risk dumping is unlikely to achieve the objective of value for money.

## Pre Construction Planning of Projects What is New?

## 6. Pre Construction Planning of Projects, What is New?

## 6.1 Introduction

The new conditions of contract will impact on the pre construction stage of projects in a number of ways:

- 1. Who is to do the design? An Employer led design team or Contractor led team;
- 2. Which form of contract? - Building or Civil Engineering;
- 3. The impact on the programme of these choices.

## 6.2 Who to do the Design?

When approaching the question of the appropriate Public Works contract, the first decision to be made is that of choice of procurement i.e. traditional or design and build.

This topic is the subject of Guidance Note - Procurement Strategy and Contract Type under the Capital Works Management Framework and will be touched on very briefly here.

## Employer Designed

The design process is contractually separate from construction and is carried out by designers engaged directly by the Contracting Authority. Complete detailed documentation is required before tenders can be invited for carrying out the work in return for a lump sum price.

## Design and Build

The Contractor is responsible for undertaking both the design and the construction of the work in return for a lump sum price.

Selection of the procurement strategy for the project entails considering the nature of the project, its risks and the programme available.   For every project the Employer should focus on time, cost, performance and quality, in relation both to design and construction of the project in order to make an informed decision on the procurement strategy.

Choice should be made always after a careful analysis of the situation and a list of questions to be considered in determination of the procurement strategy is presented below:

## Factors to Consider in Selecting the Procurement Strategy

<!-- image -->

1 Note that these should be kept to an absolute minimum

<!-- image -->

## 6.4 Alignment with Consultant's Appointments

The scope of services from the selected consultants should reflect and be aligned with the proposed procurement strategy for the project.

## 6.5 Which Form of Contract?

As between the building and civil engineering forms there are some minor differences.  However the form deployed will depend on whether the work is predominantly of a civil engineering or building nature after which consideration should be given as to whether to follow the traditional or design and build route

## Example:

A Government department requires a new green-field office building to accommodate some 200 staff to be provided on the outskirts of a major town. The options are:

- (i) Traditional procurement
- (ii) Design and build

The Client's requirements can be readily defined and it is not considered to be particularly complex project.

The design and build route is selected as it provides a single point of contractual responsibility and most likely has the shortest overall programme whilst providing maximum financial certainty.

## 6.6 The Impact on the Project Programme

Contracting Authorities need to be aware of the need to ensure that project risk issues are effectively addressed in contract documentation.  They furthermore need to be aware, that workshops to identify these risks, with Employer participation, are necessary and that there is adequate provision in the project programme to allow time for this.

Contracting Authorities should be aware of the following factors which should be considered when deciding on the programme for a project.

<!-- image -->

| The Works Requirements   | The Traditional Forms require that the Works Requirements will comprise comprehensive and well developed documentation which should include for example: • in the case of reinforced concrete works, full reinforcement drawings and not just estimated kilograms of reinforcement per m³ of concrete; • details of builder's work in connection with mechanical and electrical services installations; Employers should note that the new forms of contract have no facility for provisional sums or provisional quantities and therefore any works which in the past were dealt with by these mechanisms will now be required to be fully designed and time should be allowed in the programme for this. The Works Requirements under the Design and Build forms by their very nature are different to those of the Employer Designed forms and are discussed further later   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The Site                 | Site risk issues such as archaeology, ground conditions and utilities should be fully considered in order that appropriate and cost effective risk allocation may be achieved. The need for any enabling works contracts should also be considered as part of this strategy. The Employer has a judgement to make on the appropriate amount of preliminary work to be carried out by way of investigatory contracts, to transfer their risks in a cost effective manner and to permit tenderers assess residual risk properly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Specialists              | Requirements for any specialist contractors to carry out aspects of projects should be identified at prequalification stage as should be the manner in which the specialists are to be engaged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| The Programme Dates      | The exact project programme for the Works with start and completion dates needs to be finalised for tenderers to estimate the fixed price addition for inflation. Subsequent changes to this after tenders have been received are likely to have an impact on project costs and should be avoided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

7 The Broad Legal Perspective What is New?

<!-- image -->

## 7. The Broad Legal Perspective, What is New?

## 7.1

The Broad Legal Prospective, What is new?

In the forms  of contract presently used  (the "old forms") the contract administrator  is  specifically  either  the  Architect  or  the  Engineer.      In  the  new forms the contract administrator is the Employer's Representative ("ER") who is likely  to  be  either  an  Architect,  an  Engineer  or  other  technically  appropriately qualified person.   His role is substantially the same as that of the Architect or Engineer but there is provision for limitation on the ER's powers.

In the old forms of contract (and in many other forms) the provisions are vague enough to be interpreted in a wide manner and to give rise to claims from contractors under a variety of heads and guises.  The new forms do not permit this.  There is no looseness which would facilitate vague and imprecise claims and all adjustments to the Contract Sum will require a specific reason in the absence of which there is no provision for an adjustment.

The new forms of contract are designed to give meaning to the expression "fixed price lump sum contract".   With regard to the lump sum aspect the Contractor is to be given full and clear information as to the works to be carried out and the risks being allocated to the Contractor so as to enable him to fully price the works including those risks.   While there is provision within the Contract for adjustment to the Contract Sum the areas of such adjustment are very specifically set out and regulated and are subject to strict notice conditions. It is therefore unlikely that such adjustments will arise without easily verifiable justification.

The Contract is largely a fixed price although there is provision for adjustment in the case of extreme price fluctuations.

As  discussed  elsewhere,  some  old  forms  are  not  entirely  precise  in  their allocation  of  risk  as  between  the  parties.    In  addition,  in  many  instances  the Contractor is not given enough information at the appropriate time to enable him price risk.  This has resulted in claims and disputes.  The new forms allocate risk clearly and neither party should be in doubt as to the risks allocated to him and for which he must make provision. Also, as is stated above, the Contractor is to be given all information necessary to price such risks.

## 8 Procurement, What is New?

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## 8. Procurement - What is New?

## 8.1 Introduction

The CWMF deals with Procurement in the following guidance documents:

-  Procurement Strategy &amp; Contract Type;
-  Tendering Process;
-  Procurement Guidance for Suitability Assessment of Works Contractors;
-  Standard Instructions for Tendering.

In essence the public procurement regime is unchanged by the introduction of the new Public Works Contracts, however, the new forms introduce some new concepts and Contracting Authorities should be aware of how these should be dealt with to ensure compliance with the public procurement regime.

The main changes are:

-  The  suitability  assessment  and  procurement  of  specialists  -  the  entities which replace the nominated sub-contractor
-  Evaluation of tenders
-  The letter of acceptance

## 8.2 Specialists

Specialists can be procured in a number of ways:

- (i) Specialists are named by the bidders in their Works Proposals.  The Contractor must have named its proposed specialists in its suitability assessment submission.  It is important to note that at least one of the Contractor's proposed specialists for each "specialism" must meet the suitability assessment criteria, otherwise the Contractor will also fail to prequalify.  During the tender process, Contractors must confirm that the specialist work will be carried out by the specialist(s) that were accepted as part of the suitability assessment process.  Note that any change by a Contractor from its initially suitable  specialist to another specialist should be subject to a further suitability assessment by the Employer;
- (ii) The Employer may in exceptional circumstances name the proposed Specialist in the Works Requirements. In these circumstances a separate suitability assessment process and competition would have been held and the Specialist's tender included in the Works Requirements for the Contractor to include in its tender;
- (iii) The Employer may, in exceptional circumstances, create a panel of specialists for a particular package and let tendering Contractors for the main contract choose from the panel and/or add others they wish to

<!-- image -->

propose by reference to the criteria given to them by the Employer and against which the panel was chosen;

- (iv) Specialists could be novated to the Contractor.  This approach is broadly similar to that mentioned at (ii) above and would be considered appropriate for novated designers in a design and build scenario or where there are exceptionally long lead items.

## 8.3 Evaluation of Tenders

The significant issues that arise with the introduction of the new contracts are:

- (a) Tenders are procured on a fixed price lump sum basis and there is no subsequent negotiation of the fixed price addition as has heretofore been the case;
- (b) Where bills of quantities are used for civil engineering works, the tender is the lump sum offer and not the rates in the bill of quantities;
- (c) Daily rates for delay, all-in labour rates and percentage additions for materials and plant are to be provided by tenderers.  These will be required to be taken into account in the evaluation of tender.

Accordingly, the evaluation criterion used must be "most economically advantageous tender" and not the "lowest tender".

Where daily rates are tendered the following should be added to each tender sum for the purpose of comparing tenders:

- -The product of the provisional number of days' delay stated in the tender documents and the tenderer's daily rate of delay cost.
- -The product of the provisional number of hours for each category of craftsperson, apprentice and general operative stated in the tender documents and the tenderer's hourly rate for each.
- -The provisional cost of materials and plant in relation to compensation events stated in the tender documents multiplied by the tenderer's percentage adjustment for each.

Where daily delay rates are not tendered (delay costs to be paid on an actual cost basis), the following should be added to each tender sum for the purpose of comparing tenders:

- -The product of the provisional number of hours for each category of craftsperson, apprentice and general operative stated in the tender documents and the tenderer's hourly rate for each.
- -The provision costs of materials and plant in relation to compensation events stated in the tender documents multiplied by the tenderer's percentage adjustment for each.

<!-- image -->

## Example:

See Case Study Nr 2 and the Guidance Note on Public Works Contract

- (d)  In most circumstances there is a pricing document, which tenderers complete during the tendering period.

When a successful tender is selected and prior to issue of the letter of acceptance by the Employer, it may be necessary to deal with inconsistencies between rates, balancing of rates and errors in the pricing document - for example where not all of the items have been priced or where items may have been front loaded.

Such corrections and rebalancing are necessary so that the rates and prices can be used to value work in interim progress valuations, and also that the rates and prices can be used to value change orders should they arise.

Dealing with errors, inconsistencies and rebalancing of rates should be done and notified to the preferred bidder by the Employer before rejection of all the other tenders in case the preferred bidder does not stand over his tender.

In limited circumstances - usually only in the case of some design-and-build contracts the pricing document may be very general. In these circumstances, a number of milestone payments are normally established for interim payment purposes.  Where this is done it is preferable to indicate to bidders in the tender documents the percentage payable at each milestone.

## 8.4 Letter of Acceptance

The issue of a letter of acceptance by an Employer to a tenderer forms a binding contract. The letter must be signed by a person authorised to sign contracts on behalf of the Employer.  The Employer should make sure that all required approvals and supporting documents are in place before the letter is issued.  The letter of acceptance should not be confused with the "Alcatel" letter or a letter of intent.

9 Contract Administration -  What is New?

<!-- image -->

## 9. Contract Administration, What Is New?

The conditions set out the rights and obligations of the parties and the role the Employer's Representative plays in administering the contract. Before looking in detail at the duties of the Employer's Representative as Contract Administrator it is useful to examine some of the key aspects of the conditions under specific headings.

## 9.1 Time

| Key Dates             | Designated Date - 10 days before the last date for submission of tenders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Key Dates             | Contract Date - Date of issue by the Employer of the Letter of Acceptance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Key Dates             | Starting Date - Within 20 days of the Contract Date and as notified by the Contractor.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Key Dates             | Date for Substantial Completion - Contract date for completion of the Works. This is defined in Clause 1.1 which sets out all that is required for this to occur. There is provision for sectional completion.                                                                                       |
| Programme             | Detailed requirements set out in Clause 4.9.1. Can be part of the Works Proposals and therefore part of the Contract Documents. Failure to provide or update the programme can entitle the Employer to deduct money from payments to be made.                                                        |
| Delay Events          | Date for Substantial Completion only adjusted by Delay Events listed in the Schedule Part 1K.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Suspension            | Employer's Representative has power to suspend progress of the Works under clause 9.2 and the Contractor has power to suspend progress under Clause 12.3                                                                                                                                             |
| Liquidated Damages    | No requirement for a Certificate of Non Completion prior to such a deduction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Programme Contingency | Contract period is to include for a programme contingency for both the costs and delays arising from Compensation Events. This is not to be expended against events which are Delay Events only. A worked example of use of the programme contingency is given after Clause 9.4.4 of the conditions. |

## 9.2 Cost

## Cost Certainty

Philosophy of contract set out in Article 4 of Agreement. "The Contractor has included in the  initial  Contract Sum allowances for all risks, customs, policies, practices, and other  circumstances that may affect its performance of the  Contract, whether they could or could not have been  foreseen, except for events for which the Contract  provides for adjustment of the initial Contract Sum."

## 9.5 Price Variation Clause

The  Contracts  are  intended  to  be  Fixed  Price  Lump  Sum  over  a  36  month period  from  the  Designated  Date  (or  Recovery  Date  if  slippage  due  to  the Contractors' delay in signing up to the Contract activates a Recovery Date) This is  the  essential  position,  so  that  for  practical  purposes  the  detail  of  the  Price Variation  Clauses  may  well  not  arise.  Note  however  that  it  governs  both increase and decrease in the Contract Sum under the circumstances outlined in Optional Clause PV1 and PV2.

There are two approaches, selectable at the discretion of the Employer in the Schedule Part 1, viz:

- (a) The Proven Cost Method (PV1), and
- (b) The Formula Fluctuations Method (PV2)

## PV1 The Proven Cost Method

This is an invoice-based system whereby  the Contractor establishes his entitlement after the Fixed Price period, by invoices which are checked by the Employer  as  outlined  in  the  Guidance  Note.  Note  that  the  definition  of  Base Date under PV1 is the first day of the 31st month after the Contract Date, so that  this  approach  guarantees  the  Employer  his  30  months  fixed  price,  even  if there  should  be  delay  in  setting  the  Contract  Date.    Recovery  of  labour

increases relate to general round percentage increases under Social Partnership Agreements applied to the appropriate REA rates at the Base Date.

## PV2 The Formula Fluctuation Method

The Formula Fluctuations Method (PV2) is based on the use of CSO Indices for different categories of Materials, Fuels, CPI, as published mainly in the Wholesale Price  Indices.    The  weightings  for  each  of  Material,  Fuel,  Labour,  non-reusable temporary  works  and  non  recoverable  overheads  are  established  by  the Employer  (or  Contractor  in  DB)  and  the  proportions  of  different  fuels  and materials are also defined for use with these indices, and these proportions are provided in the ITT.

All of the formulae used in PV2 have a common basic structure, i.e.

The  Guidance  Note  has  several  examples  of  how  PV2  applies  to  Materials, Labour, Fuel, and Non Reusable Temporary Works after the Base Date, and it also includes examples of calculation of the Hyperinflation provision.

It is perhaps sufficient to explore the formula in relation to just one element, Materials, in order to establish the common approach in the other cases.

## The formula for use with PV2 in relation to Materials is:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

K is the amount which is recoverable, under the particular material heading to which the indices A1 and B1 apply via the CSO Wholesale Price Indices in Table 3A of their publication.

If, within the Contract Sum (less VAT and deductible amounts), Z , the fraction of Materials is Y%, within which Ready Mix accounts for W% , of which in turn P% is the value in the current Interim Valuation, then WYZP is the value of Ready Mix subject to indexation in this Valuation. The foregoing formula may also be expressed as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In  this  form  it  is  perhaps  more  easily  interpreted.  The  term  (A1-B1)/B1  is recognisable  as  the  proportionate  uplift  in  the  index,  at  the  later  Interim Valuation  date,  compared  to  its  value  at  the  Base  Date,  and  the 0.1 is  the threshold up to which the Contractor still carries the risk. Note that this means he  only  recovers  the  amount in excess  of 10%  of  WYZP,  and  this  is not equivalent  to  saying  "He  bears  the  risk  of  the  first  10%  of  the  increase";  it  is more exacting than that.

The term WYZP, as mentioned above, represents the sum which is subject to the  index  calculation,  for  this  particular  material,  in  this  particular  Interim Certificate.

Calculation  of  the  amount,  subject  to  the  price  variation  calculation,  in  an interim certificate after the Base Date (except for Hyperinflation) would follow along the lines of the following example, and the proportion factors in Figure 1.

Applying these together we have:

## Ready Mixed Concrete -

W x Y x Z x P  =    20% x 35% x €6,000,000 x 25%    =    €105,000

## Fabricated Structural Steel -

W x Y x Z x P  =    28% x 35% x €6,000,000 x 10%    =    €58,800

These are the sums, under the headings of Ready Mix Concrete and Fabricated Structural  Steel,  which  appear  in  the  PVC  calculation  in  the  current  Interim Valuation.    However,  it  will  only  be  the  amounts  in  excess  of  €10,500  and €5,880 respectively, ie 10% of WYZP, which will be recoverable, and then only if the index uplift generates an excess.

Clearly,  it  is  possible  that  the  formula  at  the  head  of  this  section  could  give  a value  which  is  negative,  and  this  happens  when  the  uplift  from  the  indexation calculation is less than 10%.

The Clauses of the Contract make it clear that when this happens, the outcome is a zero recovery for the Contractor.

Hyperinflation is defined in the Contract, and it can apply at any time after the Designated  Date,  which  means  it  can  apply  as  a  relief  even  during  the  "  fixed price  period"  when  normal  price  relief  does  not  apply.  The  structure  of  the

<!-- image -->

Hyperinflation  Formula  is  mathematically  the  same,  except  the  10%  of  WYZP factor  is  50%  of  WYZP  in  that  instance.  There  are  worked  examples  in  the Guidance Note of how the Hyperinflation Formula is to be applied.

## Weightings for Materials, Fuel and Other Items

In  Employer  Design  Contracts,  the  Employer  will  define  the  weighting  Y,  and weighting(s)  W  across  a  range  of  materials,  by  preparing  two  Tables,  for inclusion in the appendices to the ITT. It is important that the headings in the table  match  those  used  by  the  CSO,  so  that  there  is  unambiguously  an  index available for each material category.  Figure 1 illustrates how these weights apply down the tree into each material category and interim certificate.

In  Contractor Design, the Contractor will have to present his own weightings against  the  corresponding  materials  categories,  and  good  practice  would  then require that this be taken into the account in the MEAT calculation as part of tender appraisal. This might be done by declaring that tender comparisons would be made, based on five ranked assumed materials values, with the highest five weightings (for example) applied and taken to a sum itself taken into account in the  MEAT, to prevent any tendency to load a particular material category for advantage.

In the above example, the following indices are used:

A1 =The Adjustment Index Figure for the relevant Material or Fuel Category

B1 =The Base Index figure for the relevant Material or Fuel Category

If now  the  indices  took  the  following  values  and  we  were  considering  a September 2008 Interim Valuation:

Designated Date:

15 January, 2005

Base Date:

1 August, 2008

| CSO Indices (Material Category)   |   Jan-05 |   Aug-08 |   Sept-08 |
|-----------------------------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Ready mixed concrete              |      106 |    105.3 |    126.36 |
| Fabricated structural steel       |      102 |    109   |    124    |

The fractional amount of uplift, less the amount at the Contractors risk, can be calculated as:

Training Manual

10  The Letter of Acceptance and Agreement

<!-- image -->

## 10. The Letter of Acceptance and Agreement

## 10.1 Letter of Acceptance

The Employer must draw up and send the letter as provided for at Model Form 5 of Guidance Note for Public Works Contract - and must ensure it is clearly dated (note - Contract Date as defined in Sub-clause 1.1 of Conditions)

While there is nothing particularly unusual about the issue of a Letter of Acceptance sub-clause 1.1 of the Conditions states that the Contract Date is the date the Employer issued the Letter of Acceptance.   In turn the Conditions (sub-clause 9.1.1) provide that the Starting Date (the date the Contractor proposes to start executing the Works) must occur within 20 working days after the Contract Date.  Thus, the issue of the Letter of Acceptance is of importance in starting the entire construction project.

## Example:

The Employer is otherwise ready to accept a tender to carry out certain works but has not yet obtained possession of an important part of the Site.   In such case the Employer should never send out a Letter of Acceptance (as to do so would trigger the actual Starting Date under the Contract) unless he is absolutely certain that he can obtain possession before the date on which access to this part of the Site will actually have to be given pursuant to subclause 7.1.1 of the Conditions (or unless the Contractor's access to the Site is limited by the Works Requirements).   The Employer would not want to start time running on a process that will require access by the Contractor to a part of the Site before he knows he will be able to provide that access.

While  the  Letter  of  Acceptance  provides  for  the  incorporation  into  the  Contract  of  post tender  clarifications,  the  Employer  should  be  most  careful  not  to  break  any  EU  public procurement requirements by the inclusion in the Contract of items not tendered.

Another point worth noting is that it is intended that the Form of Tender will be a document executed by the tenderers under seal so  that  when  the  Employer  accepts  the  Tender  the resulting contract will be under seal.

## 10.2 Agreement

The Employer should ensure that the Agreement as provided in the Contract Documents is completed fully and correctly:

date of Agreement;

names of contracting parties;

initial Contract Sum;

any post tender clarifications intended to be included as contract documents.

<!-- image -->

He should ensure the Agreement is executed fully and properly by both parties, note sealing requirements for companies:

if joint venture - executed by all members

if partnership - executed by all

While there is nothing particularly new in the Agreement it does state much more clearly than in the old forms of agreement that the Contractor has fully satisfied itself of all the risks involved in carrying out the Works and has priced for them and included these in the initial Contract Sum.

It also sets out clearly the documents forming the Contract and, as has been mentioned above, provides that the Contract takes effect from the Contract Date.

## Example:

In a contract in which the Letter of Acceptance was issued on the 10th January 2007 and the Agreement  is  being  executed  on  the  25th  January  2007  the  date  to  be  inserted  into  the Agreement will be the 25th January 2007 i.e. the date of the Agreement.   This will not affect the date from which the Contract takes effect i.e. the Contract Date...

When inserting post-tender clarifications or other documents intended to be included as Contract Documents the Employer will need to consider carefully whether or not the format of the clarifications or document is such that the document as a whole may be included as a Contract Document or whether only that portion of it intended to become contractually binding should be included.

This is something that will need to be considered very carefully by the Employer and legal advice might well be required if there was doubt on the matter. It is likely that this issue will in any event be addressed by the Letter of Acceptance. In addition in this regard, attention must be paid to the EU public procurement requirements.

It would be most appropriate where post tender clarifications or  portions of other documents are to be  included in the Contract to have these distilled down into the required operative  provisions for inclusion rather than including entire minutes or other documents.

The Employer will need to consider whether or not he intends to execute the document under seal.   In general contracts for substantial public works will be executed by the Employer under seal and in accordance with the standing orders of the entity in question.   If not to be executed under seal then the Employer will need to consider who is the proper person to execute and what are the rules governing the execution under hand of a binding contract for the amount in question so as to ensure that appropriate standing orders are followed.

Although the Contract will already have been formed by the issue of the Letter of Acceptance, the Employer should, in order to avoid any confusion or  dispute on the matter at a later date, also consider in advance who on behalf of the Contractor is to execute the document and to ensure that he is satisfied the document is being executed in accordance with the regulatory requirements governing that entity.

<!-- image -->

For instance, if the Contractor is an Irish company it will generally be sufficient if the Agreement is executed under seal by the Director and the Company Secretary but it may be that at the last minute, only certain Directors are available to execute the document. In that case Employer will need to satisfy himself that they are empowered to do so and they should be able to satisfy him in this regard.  for example, by way of a resolution by the board of directors.

If the Contractor is not a company incorporated in Ireland, it should be executed in accordance with the law of the relevant jurisdiction (where it is incorporated). A legal opinion as to due execution and enforcement might usefully be required.  As the Contract is in place before the Agreement is executed the provisions of sub-clause 2.7.1 would appear to apply in these circumstances.

Again in accordance with the footnote at the end of the Agreement the Employer must ensure that if the Contractor is made up of various entities, each must execute.

11  Completing the Schedule Part I

<!-- image -->

## 11. Completing the Schedule Part 1

## 11.1 Introduction

The  Schedule  is  an  important  innovation  in  these  forms  of  contract.      While other forms of contract used in Ireland do have appendices e.g. GDLA,  IEI and FIDIC etc. none of those appendices have the level of detail set out in Schedule to the new forms.   The Schedule gives all of the necessary practical information to the parties but in addition sets out clearly matters such as for instance, the amount that will be withheld from the Contractor if he fails to provide Collateral Warranties.  It  also  sets  out  a  comprehensive  list  of  Delay  and  Compensation Events  and  gives  the  Employer  an  opportunity  to  allocate  risk  in  certain  very important  areas  to  the  Contractor  or  to  himself.      In  the  older  forms  the allocation  of  such  risk  was  not  always  clear  and  could  result  in  acrimony  and dispute between the Contractor and Employer.   In the New Forms it is clearly known  from  day  1  who  bears  the  risk  and  there  should  be  little  room  for dispute.

The Employer should ensure all risk assessments, investigations and decisions have been carried out in advance of Schedule completion.

## 11.2 Section A

The Employer must ensure that all addresses, fax numbers and e-mail addresses are entered and are correct

## Example:

See Case Study Nr 1 - The Schedule

The Employer will need to consider to what address notices under clauses 12 and 13 relating to termination and dispute resolution respectively, are to be sent.  This would for example be important if the Employer was resident in different locations or had a number of offices. There should be no room for confusion in relation to where such important notices are to be sent.

Similarly, the address of the Employer's Representative to which notices pursuant to clauses 9 and 10 relating to claims for extensions of time and/or adjustments to the Contract Sum must be sent should be accurately set out so that no confusion exists in relation to whether these notices have been served in time.

Insert any/all limitations on powers of Employer's Representative (note - if none entered, none will be considered to apply)

In relation to the potential limitations on the ER's powers it will be important for the Employer to consider carefully the limitations that should apply in each given case. This because it is not necessarily a good thing to require an ER to revert to the Employer every time he wishes to issue an instruction or a Change Order. In addition, it should be borne in mind by the Employer that it will be necessary for him to respond promptly to the ER in relation to any request for instructions in order to avoid causing any delay to the Contractor.

<!-- image -->

## See Case Study Nr 1 - Completing the Schedule Part 1

## Example:

In  the  completed  case  study  the  maximum  adjustment  to  the  Contract  Sum  as  inserted  is €5,000 unless approved by the Employer. It would be essential for the Employer to consider in  advance  and  in  the  light  of  the  size  of  the  Contract  in  question  whether  or  not  such  a permitted adjustment is appropriate or whether it should be larger or smaller.

It should be noted however, that it is not intended for any alterations to the Schedule itself to be made.

It might also be noted that if the ER were to exceed his authority under the Contract, any instruction given by him will nevertheless have effect as if it were within his authority and the Contractor is not under a duty to inquire as to whether the Employer has actually authorised it.

## 11.3 Section B

All relevant design details (in the Traditional contract) or Employer's requirements must be available when Part 1 of the Schedule is being completed.

Insert details of Works Requirements and the Pricing Document.

Historically in Irish Public Works Contracts (of the Traditional type) the design detail  provided  to  the  Contractor  varied  from  the  very  basic  to  the  very advanced.    The  New  Forms  seek  to  give  full  meaning  and  effect  to  the  term "fixed price lump sum contract" and in this context it is absolutely essential that the design is fully developed before the Contractor is asked to price.   If it is not, this will give rise to the necessity for Change Orders and claims for adjustment to the Contract Sum by the Contractor.

## See Section 13 below in relation to Works Requirements.

## 11.4 Section C

The decision as to whether the Employer requires the copyright in all Contractor's Documents must be made in advance of completion of Part 1 of the Schedule

The Employer must state in the Schedule if property rights in documents is required (note - if not stated, the rights do not transfer ( save possibly due to the general law ).

This part of the Schedule in conjunction with sub-clause 6.4 of the Conditions allows the Employer the option of obtaining intellectual property rights in the Contractor's Documents and Works Items. It would be very important for the Employer to decide if he requires such rights.  In a Design and Build Contract it would obviously be of far greater significance than in a traditional type of contract.  In a traditional type contract this would of course carry through from the Conditions of Engagement where it would be of even greater relevance. Thus there would probably be little point in having copyright in Contractor's

<!-- image -->

## Documents if the Employer did not ensure that he had copyright in the Consultants' design documents.

## Example:

If the Works were a flagship building that the Employer wished should remain unique then he might seek to obtain copyright in the design and other relevant documents.  Then he would be in a position to prevent the design and construction of the same building thus preserving its uniqueness.

Alternatively, if the Works the subject of the Contract were the first in a series of such structures to be erected around the country (e.g. schools, railway stations etc.) then the Employer might feel that it would be important for him to have the right to copy all documents and designs going forward.  However, the Contractor takes no responsibility for the use of the Contractor's Documents other than in connection with the Works. (subclause 6.4).

<!-- image -->

## 11.5 Section D

The Employer must consider carefully in relation to insurance

-  the minimum levels of insurance required from the Contractor
-  the maximum excess levels to be permitted
-  the exclusions that may be permitted
-  which  party  will  bear  risk  of  existing  property  (the  default  is  that    the Contractor bears the risk)
-  any  property  of  Employer  (other  than  Works  and  Works  Items)  to  be included in insurances
-  if terrorism insurance is required - the level of cover
-  if sectional completion, whether insurance cover is to be extended until the entire Works are certified as complete
-  whether professional indemnity insurance cover is required  and if so, the cover required, the level of excess and the period of cover
-  Insert all relevant details into Schedule

The  insurance  and  indemnity  provisions  are  not  greatly  different  from  those which would normally be provided for.

In addition there is a clear entitlement under the Contract and as set out in the Schedule for the Employer to require that Professional Indemnity insurance be taken  out  by  the  Contractor.      While  this  would  be  perfectly  normal  in  a Contractor's Design Contract it would be less usual in traditional forms.

However, it is often the case that such insurance is or should be required.

<!-- image -->

## Example:

If the Works involve any substantial degree of design on the part of the Contractor or on the part of any Specialist then unless the Employer can be fully satisfied (which is highly unlikely) that the Contractor and/or Specialist would be of sufficient stature to stand over any design by them (and satisfy any loss arising from defects arising) or that the issue is covered by the design team on the project (and their P.I. insurance) the Employer should require that Professional Indemnity insurance is obtained.

This is because the Contractor is fully responsible for all design by itself or by Specialists to the extent that they are fit for their intended purpose in the Works.  If the Contract is for Design and Build the Contractor is fully responsible for the fitness for purpose of the overall design.

## 11.6 Section E

The Employer must state whether or not a Bond is required (note- default is that  a  Bond  is  required).    The  Employer  must  provide  for  the  amount  of  the Bond as a percentage of the initial Contract Sum up to Substantial Completion and  thereafter  (note  -  the  level  of  the  Bond  depends  on  the  size  of  the Contract.  It ranges from 25% to 12.5% (see Guidance Note section 2.3). There is provision for the Bond to reduce by one half upon Substantial Completion of the Works.

## 11.7 Section F

The  Employer  must  state  if  collateral  warranties  are  required  from  certain Specialists and by what date.

## Example:

Almost by definition it is likely that a Specialist will be carrying out a design function and in many cases the Specialist company will be as substantial, if not more so, than the Contractor. For instance, some of the larger mechanical and electrical contractors are substantially larger than many of the contractors for whom they work as specialist sub-contractors.  Accordingly, unless the Employer feels that a separate warranty from the Specialist need not be provided because  of  the  likely  stature  of  the  Contractor  (who  he  will  not  of  course  know  when completing  the  Schedule)  and/or  the  fact  that  the  type  of  work  to  be  carried  out  by  a Specialist is unlikely to fail, it would be most unusual not to require such a warranty.

## Example:

The Employer is entitled to withhold from payments to the Contractor, the amount set out in  the  table  in  the  Schedule  (part1F)  in  the  event  that  the  Contractor  fails  to  provide  a collateral warranty within the time he is obliged to do so (sub-clauses 5.5 and 11.4.1).  The Employer will need to consider the amount to be withheld on the Contractor and must insert it in the Schedule.  The money will be paid to the Contractor when he provides the required warranty.  However, if he has not done so by the date of issue of the Defects Certificate, the withheld amount is deducted from the Contract Sum (sub-clause 11.4.5).

<!-- image -->

## 11.8 Section G

Unless the Contractor is required to insert the Date for Substantial Completion in part 2 of the Schedule the Employer will need to consider the date.

This will obviously be considered in conjunction with the Employer's consultants and by reference to the size of the job and the time frame within which the Works are required.   It may perhaps be that certain parts of the Works will be required separately and in that context sectional completion might be envisaged with separate Dates for Substantial Completion in each case.

If the Contractor is required to insert the Date for Substantial Completion the Employer should consider imposing (via the Works Requirements) a minimum period for completion in light of safety considerations (see comments on this point elsewhere).

If sectional  completion  is  required,  the  Employer  must  insert  the  rate  of liquidated damages for each Section and any reduction of retention moneys on Substantial Completion of a Section

Note: LADs must be a genuine pre-estimate of actual losses so as not to be a penalty and therefore unenforceable

## Example:

The rate of liquidated damages per day or per week will be inserted by the Employer and in this  regard  the  Employer  should  assess  carefully  the  likely  losses  to  be  suffered  by  the Employer  should  any  Section  or  ultimately  the  entire  Works  be  delayed  due  to  the Contractor's  default.    The  Employer  should  make  sure  that  the  amount  in  question  is  a genuine pre-estimate of likely actual losses.   In point of fact many Employers insert liquidated damages that do not take into account all of their likely losses and accordingly such liquidated damages are too low.  Obviously, the Employer should be aware that a rate which is so high that it bears no relationship to the anticipated actual losses is likely to be unenforceable as a penalty.

There is also provision here for a reduction in retention on Substantial Completion of a Section and in this regard the Employer should consider the relationship that the Section in question bears to the overall Works.

If the Section is a very substantial part of the overall Works and represents 25% of it in monetary terms, it may be appropriate to reduce the retention by a similar percentage once that section is substantially complete.  However, other factors may come into play which would result in the reduction not equating fully to the monetary relationship that the section bears to the overall works

## 11.9 Section H

The  Employer  must  state  whether  or  not  the  Employer's  Representative  is required to issue the certificate of Substantial Completion even if completion is early (note - the default is that early certification is required).

<!-- image -->

The Employer will have to decide whether or not he is happy that the ER should issue the Certificate of Substantial Completion if the Contractor completes either a Section or the entire Works before the relevant Date for Substantial Completion.   As the default is that the ER will have to issue the Certificate the decision on the Employer's part is whether he would prefer not to take over the Works or the Section early.

It might perhaps be that the Employer will not be ready for the Works until the actual Date for Substantial Completion and will not want to take it on for that reason, and particularly may not wish to have the obligation to insure, take over and provide security for the building.

## 11.10 Section I

## The Employer must insert the length of the initial Defects Period

## Example:

The Employer might wish to consider whether either a shorter period of say 6 months or a longer period of say 18 months for carrying out the snagging etc. is appropriate.   This would relate to the nature of the Works and whether the Employer feels that the Works are for example a simple but urgent job where an initial defects period of 6 months would be ample to have it fully completed.

## 11.11 Section J

The  Employer  should  state  whether  random  checks  for  employment  records may be made under sub-clauses 5.3 (note  - default is that the sub-clause providing for  such  checks  is  part  of  the  Contract).    Note  also  that  Government  policy  is  that, subject to certain parameters, such checks are to be carried out (see below).

## Example:

The Employer will need to decide whether he intends to allow for random checks to be made under sub-clause 5.3.   The default position is that such checks can be made but the Employer may decide that in certain circumstances there is unlikely to be any necessity for them.  One would envisage that it might be appropriate to leave in the entitlement even if it is not utilised by the Employer.

However, it is important to note that any such checks may only be used for the particular purpose of checking on proper payment of work persons and cannot be used for any other purpose.  (sub-clause  5.3.5)    For  instance,  the  Employer  could  not  use  the  checks  to  seek evidence in relation to Contractor's Claims.

Government policy is that if a Contract value is greater than €30 million and its duration is over 18 months - such checks will be required.

## 11.12 Section K

The  Employer  should  consider  carefully  in  light  of  investigations  made  and  of information available to the Employer and possibly to be made available to the

- 18   finds of unforeseeable archaeological interest on the Site
- 19   unforeseeable  ground  conditions  or  man-made  obstructions  in  the ground (not utilities)
- 20   unforeseeable utilities in the ground on Site
- 21 delays  by  utilities  owners  to  relocate  or  disconnect  utilities  despite compliance by the Contractor with their procedures

The Employer has to carefully consider whether it is necessary that any additional criteria be applied to an event for it to qualify as a Weather Event as defined in the Contract and which may give rise to an extension of time for completion of the Works.  The standard criteria listed in the definition of "weather event" in the Schedule part 1K are rainfall, air temperature and wind speed.

The Schedule provides for a 10 year Return Period as the level of risk to be allocated to the Contractor in this respect. This has a precise hydrological meaning, as the event which, in a long record, is likely to be exceeded once in 10 years. It is not equivalent to an event which occurred within the last decade for example.  In a project lasting perhaps 24 - 36 months at construction stage, there is a significant probability of the 10 year event occurring, be that rainfall, or wind, or temperature.  Furthermore, it is not impossible (although the probability is low) that a 10 year Return Period event could occur twice within a construction period.  The Contractor carries that risk.

The Employer must insert in the Schedule, in the table provided, any additional criteria  decided  upon  as  appropriate  to  the  Works  and  the  relevant  weather station at which those criteria will be measured.

It  would seem appropriate that Met Éireann may have to be consulted on the appropriate weather station to be entered in the Schedule by the Employer, as the  Climatological  Station  most  representative  of  conditions  at  the  Site  of  the Works.

The Employer must insert the two thresholds for the Contractor's Programme Contingency pursuant to sub-clause 9.4 (note - these thresholds should be the result of careful consideration by the Employer as to what is reasonable in all the circumstances of the Contract).

The Employer must state whether the Contractor is to be paid his daily delay costs (to be inserted by the Contractor in the Schedule part 2E at tender stage) or his actual expenses unavoidably incurred (exclusive of profit).

<!-- image -->

The Employer must insert any additional categories of workmen to come within the definition of craftsperson as set out in Part 2E of the Schedule (defined there as  persons  described  as  craftsmen  or  electricians  in  employment  agreements registered under the Industrial Relations Acts).

The Employer must state whether the Contractor is to provide in his tender for a single delay cost rate or for separate rates for particular periods or portions of the Works.  See Case Studies  1A and 1B.

## 11.13 Section L

The Employer must insert the required details in relation to interim payment the period for payment

the minimum amount for payment the value of unfixed Works Items that may be included in interim payment

(note - default is 90% of Contract value)

the percentage to be withheld as retention (note - default is 10%)

The Employer must consider what the period for payment on interim certificates should be.   This will obviously depend on the nature of the Works, the urgency for payment on the part of whatever contractor is carrying out the Works and of course the Employer's cash flow.  The normal period is monthly and this is the default as set out in the Contract.   The Employer might however in certain circumstances opt for six weekly payments to fit in with his cash flow but this would have a corresponding effect on the Contractor's cash flow.

The Employer will wish to consider the minimum amount to be paid out on an interim payment (other than retention released) and this will again depend on the size of the level of administration involved in processing interim payments. The default is that there is no minimum.

The Employer will have to decide upon the value of unfixed Works Items that may be included in an interim payment.   The default is 90%.   The Employer may feel that this is too high and that a smaller percentage would be appropriate in view of the fact that these items are not yet included in the Works.   Although the Contract significantly reduces the risk of loss due to anything that prevents Works Items being incorporated in the Works or delivered to the Site (where not  yet  delivered)  there  is  always  the  possibility  that  in  the  event  of  an insolvency their incorporation (or if not on Site, their delivery) could be delayed despite the fact that up to 90% of their value may have been discharged.  (subclause  11.2)  In  the  event  of  serious  issues  arising  the  Employer  may  well  be entitled to call on the bond to be provided by the Contractor.

## 11.14 Section M

The Employer must state which of the two price variation options is to apply pursuant to sub-clause 10.8 (note - if none specified, PV1 will apply, therefore it

<!-- image -->

is very important that the Employer addresses this issue carefully at this stage in order to avoid possible conflict at a later stage)

## 11.15 Section N

The Employer must insert the name of the body that is to appoint the conciliator for the purpose of sub-clause 13.1.2 in the event of a dispute arising

The Employer must insert the name of the body that is to appoint the arbitrator for the purpose of sub-clause 13.2 in the event of a dispute arising that is not resolved by conciliation.

The Employer will wish to consider what appointing body to nominate for the appointment of the conciliator and the arbitrator pursuant to clause 13.

The approved professional bodies are:

-  Bar Council of Ireland
-  Chartered Institute of Arbitrators - Irish Branch
-  Engineers Ireland
-  Law Society of Ireland
-  Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland
-  Society of Chartered Surveyors

In this regard the Employer might wish to consider whether or not in the context of a building contract the conciliator or arbitrator should definitely be an Architect in which case he might feel it appropriate to utilise the RIAI as the appointing body. This would result in the appointment of an Architect as the conciliator or arbitrator.  Alternatively, if the view is in a civil engineering project that the conciliator should be an Engineer, then Engineers Ireland should perhaps be the appointing body.

Alternatively, the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators - Irish Branch or one of the other bodies listed might be the preferred option if neither of the above area of expertise was required. For instance, if the dispute were purely a quantity surveying issue then the Society of Chartered Surveyors might be more appropriate.

## 12  Completing the Schedule Part 2

<!-- image -->

## 12. Completing The Schedule Part 2

The Contractor completes the Schedule part 2.

## 12.1 Section A

This section contains the addresses for sending notices and other communications to the Contractor and is as important here as it is in part 1 of the Schedule.

## 12.2 Section B

The Contractor states here if he intends to provide a parent company guarantee for tender purposes.

## 12.3 Section C

This section contains the Contractor's Works proposals See notes in relation to the Works Proposals.

## 12.4 Section D

This section contains the Dates for Substantial Completion and will be completed by the Contractor only if the Employer has not set out the relevant date(s) in part 1. However, the Contractor is not permitted to insert any dates for Sectional completion.

## 12.5 Section E

This section is where the Contractor sets out his tendered hourly rates for labour and related costs - e.g. PRSI, tool money, travelling time and country money etc. in respect of Craftspersons, General Operatives and Apprentices.

He also sets out here:

-  His tendered percentage addition for materials
-  His tendered percentage addition or deduction for costs of plant
-  his  tendered  rate  of  delay  costs  per  Site  Working  Day  (for  the  entire Works or portions of the Works) (Note - if the tendered delay costs are left blank by the Contractor or are stated as a negative, they are to be read as  zero).

13  Works Requirements, Works Proposals and Pricing Document

<!-- image -->

## 13. Works Requirements, Works Proposals and Pricing Document

## 13.1 Works Requirements

These contain the Employer's requirements for the Works

It is also important that the Contractor is provided with all relevant information so as to enable him to price the risks being imposed on him. The Employer should possibly furnish:

-  site surveys  subject  to  such  caveats  as  may  be  appropriate  (eg,  that interpretation is the responsibility of the Contractor)
-  archaeological surveys
-  utility  details

It is essential therefore that the Employer does not proceed to tender prematurely (ie, before fully detailed Works Requirements are prepared) despite any pressures on him to do so.

In the case of a Design and Build Contract the Works Requirements will contain a robust output specification or specimen design so that the Contractor can fully understand and price what is required of him and so that the Employer will get what he requires.

Archaeological Surveys can range from a desk study level of detail, to a field investigation with geophysics and investigation trenches, depending on the known history of the site and the area. Fieldwork associated with archaeology requires permissions from the NMS of the DoELG, and can involve a significant lead-in time. It is clearly important, when the risk associated with archaeological artefacts is being transferred to the Contractor, that the level of prior investigation is selected to manage that risk transfer effectively, so that it is appropriate to transfer it, and that such transfer represents value for money.

Utility details would be approached initially by researching the as-constructed records of the Utilities in question and from local knowledge. This might be followed by cable detection surveys, and trial trenches to confirm the positions of buried services.

Again these approaches represent a continuum of prior effort by the Employer to manage risk to a level where it can be effectively transferred to the Contractor.

- a. Statement of any materials from excavation and demolition to which the Employer will retain title.

## Notes: Refer to Standard Template Public Works Tender Document.

Contracting authorities should consider the risks of including site surveys, site investigation reports, archaeology reports, etc. in Works Requirements.  An alternative would be to provide such information with tender documentation as relevant background information; notwithstanding this, such documents should be accurate and proportionate to the nature and scale of the proposed Works.

## 13.3 Works Proposals

These will include method statements, Contractor's design and any other information required by the Employer in relation to the carrying out of the Works

## Example:

Works  proposals  from  the  Contractor  will  vary  depending  on  whether  the  Contract  is Traditional or Design and Build.

With Traditional, the Contractor would be likely to prepare his intended sequence of work, his programme, his resource allocation and his method statements as an integrated package of information, in response to the Contract Documents, including whatever constraints are stipulated by the Employer therein.

In a civil engineering project, for example, he would indicate how he proposed to deploy available working space around structures, showing locations where he might safely stockpile excavated material, or locate concrete batching plant and aggregate stockpiles materials, or

<!-- image -->

the like. Alternatively, he would outline other arrangements he may have made to obtain additional lands, licences and permits in order to free up working space on a particularly congested site. His sequences would address the question of re-use of materials, and disposal of C&amp;D wastes. If he considers that Road Closures are required to perform the works, he would outline their sequence, duration, alternative routes to be used, and the like.

His proposed working methodologies would be described, including any measures for environmental or HSW protection.

With Design and Build, the Works Proposals will include information similar to the foregoing, but also the Contractor's Design itself, including drawings of temporary and permanent Works, finishes schedules, calculations and all necessary information to enable the ER to technically assess the proposal in Tender Appraisal.

## 13.4 The Pricing Document

The Pricing Document can be a bill of quantities  (traditional contracts only), contract sum analysis or pricing schedule.

Its format and content should facilitate the following:

-  Evaluation of tenders;
-  Interim payment;
-  Valuation of change orders;
-  Calculation of price variation entitlements;
-  Recording and classification of costs in accordance with the CWMF.

Subject to the foregoing, bills of quantities (if used) should be prepared in accordance with the standard methods of measurement approved by the GCCC and should incorporate any GCCC amendments.  Refer to Guidance Note.

Where bills of quantities are not provided by the Employer, such as for design and build contracts, the Pricing Document will, subject to the foregoing, be broken down to an acceptable level such as milestones. This detail however is unlikely to be sufficient for the valuation of change orders and the  Contract Sum should be further broken down into parcels of work of similar character.

The following would be an example of such a trade breakdown for design and build building contract.  It is unlikely that all the headings given will be required for a every project and in some cases the complexity of the work may require additional parcels or sub-division of those listed. The breakdown should be given separately for each building or discrete section of work.

Public Works Construction Contracts

Training Manual

14  Commentary on the Conditions

<!-- image -->

## 14. Commentary on the Conditions

## 14.1 Definitions

Reference sub-clause 1.1

## "Contractors Documents"

Means drawings, specifications and other written (including electronic) material the Contractor prepares or  uses relating to the Works, gives or is to give to the Employer or other person

-  Under the Works Requirements
-  Under any Legal Requirements
-  To obtain any consent

In connection with a value engineering proposal (sub-clause 4.8).

## "Contractor Things"

Means things the Contractor or Contractor's Personnel use (on or adjacent to the Site) to execute the Works but excludes Works Items.

## "Contractor's Personnel"

The term is very widely defined.

It means the Contractor's Representative, his supervisor and all sub-contractors, and other persons including all employees (of the Contractor and subcontractors) and other persons assisting the Contractor to carry out the Works and working on or adjacent to the Site.

## "Site"

Means any place the Works are to be carried out, or provided by the Employer for the Works, where the Contractor is to operate Employer's Facilities, or

Any places that is identified as part of the Site by the Works Requirements.

## "Specialist"

## Means

-  A Subcontractor or supplier of a Works Item named in the Contract
-  Contractor's Personnel who do or are to do design
-  Contractor's  Personnel  specifically  stated  to  be  Specialists  in  the  Works Requirements

<!-- image -->

## "Site Working Day"

Means a day on which the Contractor is to carry out the Works.

## "Substantial Completion"

This term is very widely defined.

The  Works  are  complete  and  can  be  taken  over  and  used  for  their  purpose when:

There are no defects save

-  ones accepted by the Employer (sub-clause 8.5.4)
-  minor  defects
- -that do not prevent use of Works for their purpose
- -the  Employer's  Representative  agrees  the  Contractor  has  reasonable grounds for not promptly fixing them
-  those whose fixing will not prejudice safe and convenient use of the Works (or part)

All tests have been passed (that must be passed before Substantial Completion)

Documents required before Substantial Completion have been furnished

Collateral warranties have been provided in relation to the Works or relevant part

See commentary on Substantial Completion below.

## "Interpretation"

Reference sub-clause 1.2

Any reference to a "working day" is to a day that is not a weekend day, a public holiday under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 or Good Friday.

## "Inconsistencies"

Reference  sub-clause 1.3

The order of precedence of the Contract documents  is

- 1 The Agreement
- 2 The Letter of Acceptance
- 3 The Schedule
- 4 The Conditions
- 5 The Works Requirements
- 6 The Pricing Document

<!-- image -->

- 7 The Works Proposals
- 8 Any other Contract documents

## 14.2 Health and Safety

Reference sub-clauses 1.1 and 2.5

In the Traditional Form, the Contractor is obliged to ensure the Works are constructed so as to be safe and without risk to safety and health and so as to comply fully in all respects with the relevant statutory provisions

The Contractor also warrants that he is a competent person within the meaning of that term in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 for the purpose of ensuring that the Works are safely constructed and comply with the relevant statutory provisions.

In the Design and Build  Form the Contractor is obliged to ensure the Works are designed and capable of being constructed so as to be safe and without risk to safety and health; that they can be maintained safely and without risk to health during subsequent use; that they comply with the relevant statutory provisions.

In both Forms the Contractor warrants that he is competent to carry out the Works and will allocate sufficient resources so as to comply with the relevant statutory provisions.

The terms used in the clause including the "competent" and "relevant statutory provisions" are to be construed pursuant to section 2 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005.

The provisions in the Contracts in this regard are quite short and simple but as the laws applicable to health and safety are now so strict in this jurisdiction,  that is all that is required.

## 14.3 Loss, Damage and Injury

## Employer's Risks - Loss and Damage to the Works and Contractor's Care of the Works

Reference sub-clauses 3.1 and 3.2

The Employer bears certain risks in relation to loss of or  damage to the Works. These include the usual uninsurable risks relating to war, invasion, pressure waves caused by aircraft, and contamination relating to explosive nuclear weapons etc.  The risk of terrorism is included as an Employer's risk but only if this is a permitted exclusion from the Contractor's insurances relating to the Works.

The Employer also bears the risk of damage to the Works from the use or occupation of the Works by the Employer or the Employer's Personnel (other than as provided for in the Contract)  but excluding loss or damage caused by

<!-- image -->

the negligence of the Contractor or those for whom the Contractor is responsible or which is caused by the Contractor's breach of contract.

If Sub-clause 3.8 applies (only if so stated in the Schedule part 1D) the Employer will bear responsibility for damage to existing facilities due to the usual property risks of fire, flood, storm, pipes bursting etc.

The Employer also bears the risk of his design of the Works unless the design is covered by professional indemnity insurance taken out by the Contractor.  Subclause 3.1(6)

## Example:

If the Works are damaged because of any of the causes referred to in sub-clause 3.1 the Employer will bear the risk and will have to pay to have the Works reinstated subject to an entitlement to terminate the Contractor's responsibility to complete the Works.

The Contractor has otherwise got full responsibility for the care of the Works and bears the risk of loss and damage to the Works including Works Items, Contractors, Things, Works Requirements, Works Proposals, and Contractor's Documents together with anything the Employer provides to the Contractor for the Works.  These items are defined in the Contract as "Risk Items".

The Contractor's obligation runs from (and includes) the Starting Date up until the issue of the Certificate of Substantial Completion of the Works (or if completed in sections - the relevant Section).  If part of the Works is taken over before Substantial Completion the obligation ends for that part when the Employer takes it over.

The Contractor still has some responsibility for damage to the Works after the date of Substantial Completion.  These include damage arising from defects or from matters that occurred before Substantial Completion.  In addition if any damage to the Works is caused after Substantial Completion by activities of the Contractor or those for whom he is responsible this is at the Contractor's risk.

The Contractor is obliged to repair any loss or damage to any of the Risk Items (this is irrespective of responsibility) and must do so at his own expense if the insurance proceeds are insufficient for the purpose.  The Contractor must in any event repair any damage to the Works occurring before the issue of the Defects Certificate if the Employer instructs him to do so (subject to payment for the Works  in  the  event  that  the  risk  is  not  one  for  which  the  Contractor  is responsible).

## Insurance of the Works

Reference sub-clause 3.3, Schedule (part 1D)

The Contractor must insure the Works and the other Risk Items, against loss or damage  and  must  procure  that  the  Contractor,  Employer,  and  other  persons nominated  by  the  Employer  are  named  as  co-insured  under  the  policy  of insurance.  The insurance is to be kept in place until the date of the Certificate

<!-- image -->

of Substantial Completion.  Where there are Sections the insurance must remain in place until the Substantial Completion of the Section in question.

The Employer may require in the Schedule (part 1D) that the insurance for any Section or part of the Works which has reached Substantial Completion is to be extended until Substantial Completion of the entire of the Works.

The Contractor must maintain the insurance of the Works between Substantial Completion and the issue of the Defects Certificate in respect of damage for which he is responsible.

The insurance level must include as a minimum for the full reinstatement cost of the property, demolition and debris removal, delivery, professional fees, inflation during the construction and reinstatement periods and profit.  The Employer is entitled to insert in the Schedule (part 1D) any other property belonging to the Employer that is to be included in the insurance of the Works and the indemnity limit for such additional insurance.

In the event of a claim against the insurance the insurance proceeds (excluding the insured sum for professional fees to be paid by the Employer) are to be paid into a bank account in joint names of the Employer and Contractor and are to be paid out to the Contractor on the basis of interim certificates by the ER relating to the rectification of the loss or damage.  The Employer is entitled to be paid out of the account for costs incurred by it in this regard and is also entitled to the balance remaining in the account after rectification work.

## Example:

If the Works are fully insured in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause 3.3. and if a fire that arises on Site damages a substantial portion of the Works, then the Contractor would typically  be  instructed  to  repair  the  damaged  Works  which  includes  demolition  of  the damaged part, removal of the debris from the Site, and reinstatement.  Additional professional fees  would  be  incurred  in  dealing  with  design.    The  Contractor  would  submit  interim statements  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Contract  and  the  ER  would  certify payment on foot of these.

The  Insurer  of  the  Works  would  pay  out  the  insurance  proceeds  which  (other  than professional  fees  in  the  circumstances  of  a  traditional  contract)  would  be  paid  into  a  joint bank account set up by the Employer in the joint names of the Employer and the Contractor. These monies would be paid out on foot of interim certificates by the ER as stated above.  In relation to professional fees, assuming this was a traditional form of contract; the Employer would discharge the additional consultant's fees and would be paid out of the bank account. Subject  to  any  entitlement  which  the  insurer  might  have,  the  Employer  would  be  paid  the balance remaining in the bank account after payment for the reinstatement of the Works.

## Indemnity and Liability

Reference sub-clauses 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, Schedule (part 1D)

The Contractor provides a full indemnity to the Employer and the Employer's employees against all liability and loss of or damage to the Employer's property including the Site arising from the performance of the Contract.  If the Employer states in the Schedule (part 1D) that sub-clause 3.8 will apply, then the Employer

<!-- image -->

bears  the  risk  of  existing  facilities  and  their  contents  where  owned  by  the Employer and caused by the usual perils of:

-  Fire, storm, tempest, flood
-  Bursting or overflowing of water tanks, apparatus or pipes
-  Explosion, impact, aircraft
-  Riot, civil commotion or malicious damage

The indemnity specifically excludes any liabilities of the Employer to the Contractor under the Contract and also anything covered by the Employer's indemnities under sub-clauses 3.5 or 6.2

The  Employer  in  turn  indemnifies  the  Contractor  pursuant  to  sub-clause  3.5 against  liability  arising  from  the  Employer's  negligence  or  property  damage unavoidably  arising  from  the  execution  of  the  Works  (in  accordance  with  the Works Requirements).

Note that this indemnity does not cover liability for death, injury or illness of Contractors Personnel (i.e. those covered by the Contractor's Employer's Liability insurance cover).

The  Contractor  is  obliged  to  provide  Public  Liability insurance  with  the Employer and the Contractor as co-insured parties from the Starting Date until the issue of the Defects Certificate (sub-clause 3.6.1).

The  Contractor  must  take  out  Employer's  Liability  insurance  for  his  own personnel  and  in  relation  to  Sub-Contractors  he  must  either  ensure  that  the Sub-Contractors  maintain  the  insurance  or  otherwise  cover  the  risk  himself (sub-clause 3.6.2).

The Employer provides for the indemnity limits in respect of the Contractor's Public Liability and Employer's Liability insurances in the Schedule (part 1D).

The only noteworthy point here is that the Public Liability policy is taken out with the Employer and the Contractor as co-insured whereas in the past in building contracts it would have been in the sole name of the Contractor with an indemnity to the Employer as principal and in the engineering form it would have been joint insurance.

The Contractor is required to ensure that the Public Liability and Employer's Liability insurances are in place in the event of his return to the site (in connection with the Works) even after the Defects Certificate is issued (subclause 3.6.4).

The Employer is entitled to provide in the Schedule (part 1D) that the Contractor should put in place Professional Indemnity insurance cover.  The minimum indemnity limit will be inserted in the Schedule (sub-clause 3.7).

The Contractor if required to do so, must put in place Professional Indemnity Insurance from the Starting date until the sixth anniversary of the Certificate of Substantial Completion (unless another period is provided for in the Schedule).

<!-- image -->

The insurance must cover (retroactively if necessary) any design by the Contractor of the Works and Works items.

The Employer would be likely to require Professional Indemnity insurance in most if not all instances where the Contract is one with Contractor's Design. Professional Indemnity insurance covers errors or omissions in design work and in other professional duties.  The Employer should require that the Contractor puts in place Professional Indemnity insurance in most cases where there is an element of design being carried out by the Contractor or Specialists.  It would be normal to require that such insurances are kept in place for at least six years after Substantial Completion.  This is because the statute of limitations in respect of Professional Liability will run for at least this period.  It is also likely that such defects will come to light within such a period.

The Employer should take care to monitor the Contractor's insurances either through the ER or directly through his own insurance advisors or by himself particularly so as to make sure that the Contractor's Professional Indemnity insurance is renewed each year unless (which would be most unusual - one insurance policy is actually taken out to cover a six year period).

This is particularly important in the case of Professional Indemnity insurance because such insurance operates on a "claims made" basis.  That is to say, any claim is covered by the insurance that is in place during the year in which the claim is made.

Thus if the Contractor discontinues his Professional Indemnity insurance after 2 years and a claim is made in year 3 there will be no cover.  The Employer in completing the Schedule will also wish to consider the minimum indemnity limit. This should be a reasonable sum by reference to the value of the Works, the importance of the design work being carried out and the effect that a failure of such design work would have.  One would expect that Professional Indemnity cover nowadays would be at the very least €6.5 million and possibly €10 million in the aggregate.

The  Employer  is  also  entitled  to  stipulate  that  the  professional  indemnity insurance will cover each and every event.  In such a case the full insured sum would be available for  every  claim  raised  by  the  Employer  (within  a  particular year  of  cover).    However,  the  normal  Professional  Indemnity  insurance  by Contactors is an aggregate sum for each year.  That is to say a sum insured of €10 million will cover all claims made against the Contractor during the year in question.    The  risk  with  this  type  of  cover  is  that  the  entire  insured  amount could  be  used  up  by  one  single  claim  and  in  the  event  of  other  claims  arising there would be no insurance cover left to meet them.

It is provided in the Schedule that the sum indemnified may include defence costs.  The Employer should be careful if prosecuting a claim against an Insured where such costs are included in the cover, to take cognisance of this fact as, if a substantial legal defence was mounted to any claim the legal costs incurred by the defendant would eat away at the limit of indemnity leaving a diminishing "pool" for the Employer to claim against.

<!-- image -->

The  Contractor  must  place  his  insurance  with  insurers  approved  by  the Employer and may only exclude from cover the exclusions listed in the schedule (part 1D).

Any liability insurance where the Employer and Contractor are co-insured must include various provisions so that the Insurer cannot claim against either of the insured  persons  themselves  and  that  they  are  each  treated  as  if  they  were separately insured.

The  Contractor  is  obliged  contractually  to  comply  with  all  the  terms  of  the insurance policies.

The Contractor must provide evidence to the Employer that the insurances are in  effect  and must provide copies of policies and receipts for premiums in this regard.   An Insurance Broker's Certificate (or one from an underwriter) may be provided in the case of Professional Indemnity insurance.

This is particularly important in the context of firstly checking on the Contractor's insurances in advance of his coming on site and secondly keeping a check on the Contractor's insurance during the course of the Works.

The Contractor must notify the Employer promptly of any cancellation, renewal, non-renewal or material reduction of the terms of any policy.

While this clauses imposes a contractual obligation on the Contractor to notify of these events it is imperative that the Employer or the E.R. keep an ongoing check on Contractor's insurances as it is possible that a Contractor who is in a position whereby some of his insurances are being cancelled would not inform the Employer or the E.R. of this fact readily.

The Employer is of course entitled to take out insurance should the Contractor fail  to  maintain them.  However, it would not be possible for the Employer to take out Professional Indemnity insurance in respect of Contractor or at least not to do so without great difficulty.

The Works Requirements may make provision for an owner controlled insurance programme and in such a case the provisions of clause 3 are to be amended accordingly (sub-clause 3.9.9).

## Example:

If  the  Works  involve  very  substantial  and  complex  work  over  many  adjoining  areas  with numerous  Specialists  it  might  be  deemed  appropriate  by  the  Employer  to  control  the insurance programme rather than running the risk of any insurance failures.  However, careful investigation would need to be done by the Employer in this regard particularly in relation to the cost of taking out such a programme as it is unlikely to be as economic for an Employer to take out such insurance as it would be for a Contractor to do so.

## 14.4 Management

## Co-operation

## Reference sub-clause 4.1

The  Contract  provides for co-operation between  both  parties but very importantly states that such co-operation does not alter the rights or  duties of the parties or imply any admission of responsibility.

## Examples of co-operation are given such as:

-  Negotiation of agreements provided for in the Contract;
-  Value Engineering;
-  Use  of  most  effective  and  compatible  electronic  and  other    methods  of communicating and recording;
-  Efficient order and timing of information provided for in the Contract;
-  Minimising the effects of suspension;
-  Efforts by the Contractor to minimise delay and Compensation Events and their effects; and
-  Contractor's effective management.

This  provision  permits  either  the  Employer  or  the  Contractor  to  request consultations,  clarifications, workshops  etc.  even  though  not  provided  for elsewhere in the Contract.

The parties can (if circumstances otherwise permit) also enter into without prejudice communications which would enable them to speak freely without fear of any admission being used against them - (sub-clause 4.1.4).

## Contractor's Representative and Supervisor

## Reference sub-clause 4.2

The  Contractor  must  appoint  the  Contractor's  representative  before  the Starting Date with full authority to act on his behalf (sub-clause 4.2).

He must also appoint a full-time supervisor on site with full authority to receive instructions.  This  can  be  the  same  person  as  the  Contractor's  Representative (sub-clause 4.2).

The ER may require removal of the representative or supervisor due to misconduct, negligence or incompetence (sub-clause 4.2.3).

## Employer's Representative

Reference sub-clause 4.3

<!-- image -->

## Appointment of Employer's Representative

The Employer appoints the Employer's Representative (ER) to administer the Contract (note - likely to be his consulting engineer or architect but not necessarily so under the Contract).

## Example:

The Employer may wish to consider what profession is best suited to administer the Contract taking  into  account  the  type  of  contract  that  it  is  and  the  best  method  of  having  it administered. The  Employer  might consider that an Architect would  be the best administrator in the context of building works while an Engineer would be the best person to administer the carrying out of a road or waterworks contract.   However, under particular circumstances  the  Employer  might  consider  that  a  person  with  pure  project  management experience  and  qualifications  might  be  best  suited  to  administer  some  very  large  scale projects crossing over the divide between pure building and civil engineering with a view to coordinating a large number of consultants.

The Employer should name the ER in the Schedule (part 1A).

Otherwise  -  the  Employer  must  appoint  the  ER  promptly  after  the  Contract Date and must notify the Contractor of his identity (sub-clause 4.3.1).

Any limits on the authority of the ER must be stated in the Schedule (Part 1A).

See the reference to this above in relation to the Schedule Part 1A where such limitations are set out.

The Employer must give approvals in relation to any matters on which the authority of ER is limited.

## Example:

If the authority of the ER is limited in relation to say adjustments to the Contract Sum for a single instruction then the Employer must be prepared to provide approvals when required by the ER to do so in this context.   The Employer must be aware that approvals will often be required at relatively  short notice  and that  unless  they are  approved promptly by him this may hold up the provision of instructions to the Contractor with potential resultant delays to the Works.

## Replacement of ER

Reference sub-clause 4.3.5

Where relevant - the Employer can replace the ER (presumably he would in such a case dismiss the ER pursuant to the terms of his conditions of engagement) (sub-clause 4.3.5)

<!-- image -->

## Example:

In a situation where the Employer's Representative is not performing as he is obliged to do so pursuant to his own Conditions of Engagement then it may be necessary for the Employer to terminate  his  appointment.      However,  the  Employer  should  ensure  that  a  replacement  is appointed  as  quickly  as  possible  as  the  Employer  will  be  obliged  to  carry  out  the  ER's functions  in  the  interim.      The  carrying  out  of  the  ER's  functions  will  place  an  additional burden  on  the  Employer  to  ensure  that  these  functions  are  carried  out  properly  and professionally in order to avoid any disputes at a later stage

## ER's Communications

## Reference sub-clause 4.4

The various types of ER's communications are set out at sub-clause 4.4 of the Contract.  They may consist of:

-  Directions;
-  Change Orders;
-  Objections under sub-clause 4.7;
-  Opinions, assessments determinations and certificates;
-  Other communications in accordance with the Contract.

## ER's Instructions

## Reference sub-clause 4.5

The Contractor must comply with any instruction of the ER (sub-clause 4.5.1).

The Contractor is entitled to give notice under clause 10.3 if he feels that an instruction  which  the  ER  has  issued  as  a  direction  is  in  fact,  a  Change  Order. The  matter  will  then  be  resolved  by  the  procedure  set  out  in  sub-clauses 10.3/10.5.

The  Contract  explicitly  says  that  the  ER  may  not  give  a  Change  Order  after Substantial Completion (except in relation to Defects or work carried out after Substantial Completion) (sub-clause 4.5.3).

If the ER is of the view that it is physically impossible or illegal to carry out the Works in accordance with the Works Requirements or if it is necessary in his opinion, for the  completion of the Works, he must give a Change Order and must do so within the time allowed in sub-clause 4.11 (sub-clause 4.5.4).

ER's instructions must in the normal way, be given in writing although this will not be necessary in cases of emergency, provided the instructions are confirmed in writing as soon as practicable.

<!-- image -->

## Works Proposals

## Reference sub-clause 4.6.1

It is the responsibility of the Contractor to make sure that the Works Proposals submitted by him comply with the Works Requirements.

In respect of any Works Proposals that do not comply with the Contract, the Works Requirements or Legal Requirements or that are impossible to comply with,  the  Contractor  must  propose  a  change  to  the  Works  Proposals.    The Change is submitted to the ER (sub-clauses 4.6.1 and 4.6.2).

## Submissions by Contractor to ER

Reference sub-clause 4.7

A  detailed  procedure  for  the  making  of  any  submissions  required  under  the Contract by the Contractor to the Employer  is set out in the Contract (subclause 4.7).

In the case of any document to be submitted to the ER:

-  The  Contractor  must  give  it  together  with  all  supporting  documentation; and
-  If requested, further additional information
-  Sufficient to enable the ER to review the matter.

The Contractor is not entitled to implement any submission until the period for objection  is  ended  and  if  the  ER  objects  the  Contractor  must  make  a  new submission within the relevant period (sub-clauses 4.7.7 and 4.7.8).

## Objecting to Submissions by Contractor

Reference sub-clause 4.7.2

The ER may object to submissions made by the Contractor.  Such an objection must  be  made  within  10  working  days  of  the  receipt  by  him  of  sufficient information to enable him to review the matter (sub-clauses 4.7.2 and 4.7.4).

The Contractor may be required to provide documents for the consideration by the Employer's Representative.   The Employer should ensure that he is given all copies of such submissions by the ER so that he will be in a position to make any objection that he deems appropriate to such submissions.  Obviously, the Employer would only make such objections in accordance with the Contract (see below).

This is an important point in that there is no longer any approval by the ER and therefore there will be no opportunity for a Contractor to allege that the Employer has "assumed ownership of" a proposal by the Contractor, giving credence for a claim for compensation in circumstances where say, the proposal resulted in additional cost to the Contractor.

<!-- image -->

The  grounds  for  objection  by  the  ER  to  a  submission  by  the  Contractor  are clearly set out at sub-clause 4.7.10 as follows:

To proceed on foot of the submission:

-  Would not comply with the Contract
-  Would have an adverse effect on the Employer or the public interest
-  Would impose an obligation on the Employer that the Contract does not require him to bear
-  Would be contrary to a Legal Requirement
-  Would have an adverse effect on the Contractor's ability to comply with the Contract
-  Any other stated ground in the Contract

## Consideration of Value Engineering Proposals

Reference sub-clause 4.8

The Contractor is  entitled  to  submit  value  engineering  proposals  to  the  ER  if they would reduce the Contract Sum, accelerate the time for execution of the Works or provide some other benefit to the Employer but with no additional cost.  In point of fact, as, the Contractor is not to be paid any extra for doing so, it is highly unlikely that he would make any such proposal unless it represented a significant benefit to him in terms of time or money.

The  Employer  may  agree  to,  or  reject  value  engineering  proposals  from  the Contractor and any such rejection is conclusive.

The Employer should again ensure that he is in receipt of all such proposals in a timely  fashion  so  that  he  can  make  a  considered  decision  in  relation  to  the proposal and agree to it or reject it. (sub-clause 4.7)

It is noteworthy that if there are any design changes to the Works arising out of or as part of the value engineering proposals, the Contractor must undertake this design and be responsible for it (sub-clause 4.8.4).

## Programme

## Reference sub-clause  4.9

The Contractor must submit a detailed programme to the ER before the Starting Date  unless  he  has  already  done  so  with  the  Works  Proposals  updated  as necessary to show actual programme dates.

The requirements for the content of the programme are set out at sub-clause 4.9.1 at items (1) to (9) and are very comprehensive indeed.  There is provision for the ER to relax these requirements.  Nevertheless, the ER should give careful thought to any such relaxation.

<!-- image -->

There are two provisions in the programming requirements of the Engineering Works forms which are not in the Building Works forms and they relate to the order  and  times  for  carrying  out  "trial  operation"  of  Works  Items  and  the method  by  which  the  Contractor  proposes  to  carry  out  the  Works  and  any temporary works.

It  will  be  most  important  for  the  Employer  in  conjunction  with  the  ER  to  ensure  that  the Contractor's programme is of an adequate quality so that it can be used as a tool to monitor the Contractor's Works and properly assess progress etc.   It this regard it is noteworthy that there are sophisticated computer programmes available for the purpose of assessing programmes to ascertain  their  validity. It would  be  particularly  important  for  the  Employer  that  the Contractor's programme does (as it is required to do under sub-clause 4.9.2) provide adequate periods of time for the Employer to comply with his obligations.

The Contractor must when directed by the Employer's Representative submit a revised  programme  where  actual  progress  does  not  equate  to  the  initial programme.  The revised programme must show any delay.

All  programmes  should  show  items  1-9  as  set  out  in  Clause  4.9.1  of  the Contract (subject to any relaxation of the requirements by the ER) (sub-clause 4.9.4).

If the Contractor fails to submit a revised programme within 15 working days of a request from ER the Employer may withhold 15% of any payment due until it is submitted.

## Progress Reports

## Reference sub-clause 4.10

Progress reports must be provided by the Contractor to the ER monthly from the Starting Date to the completion of all work still outstanding at Substantial Completion.  Thus progress reports are required during the Defects Period in respect of remedial work.

Progress  Reports  are  extremely  important  and  it  will  be  essential  for  the Employer to receive copies of them from the ER so that the Employer is kept fully up to date on progress and can query the issues that he may wish to,  when attending at meetings with the ER and if necessary Site meetings.  In particular, and as referred to above it will be important for the Employer to monitor with the ER details of when any Works Items or other things to be provided by the Employer will be required and any that the Contractor says are outstanding.  It would also be vital where the Contractor has provided details of anything that might  have  an  adverse  affect  on  the  execution  of  the  Works  and  where  the Contractor proposes that the Employer or the Employer's Personnel take steps to reduce those risks.

The Contractor must furnish  progress  reports  within  7  days  after  the  end  of each relevant month.

Progress  Reports  must  include  items  1-12  in  sub-clause  4.10.2  unless  this requirement is relaxed by the ER or by the Works Requirements.

<!-- image -->

The form of the progress reports must be agreed with the ER.

## Notice and Time for Employer's Obligations

Reference sub-clause 4.11

The Contractor is  required  by  the  Contract  to  give  at  least  10  working  days notice  of  the  date  by  which  he  requires  instructions,  Works  Items  or  other things from the ER or the Employer

The date by which the ER or the Employer must provide any required instruction, Works Item or other thing to the Contractor is the latest of:

-  Any  date shown in the Contract
-  Any  date shown in the Contractor's programme;
-  Any  date for which the Contractor first notifies the ER that it is required
-  The  date  the  Contractor  actually  needs  it  by  reference  to  his  progress. (sub-clause 4.11.2)

## Example:

In a case where the Employer is required to give the Contractor any required Works Items or other thing then it would be most important that the Employer is aware of all relevant dates by which such items will be required well in advance from the ER so that he is in a position to provide the items in a timely manner.   If the item is going to require a long lead-in time from the Employer's point of view it may be appropriate that the date is stated in the Works Requirements so that the Employer can work to it in order to avoid any question of late provision of information and any resultant delays.

## Example:

The  Contractor  may  require  additional  information  which  the  ER  is  not  able  to  give  and which only the Employer can provide and in such case it will be incumbent on the Employer to provide the information/Works Items by the requisite dates.   If it were the case that there was no date in the Contract or the Programme or that the Works Item was not available by either of those dates and it was clear that the Contractor's actual progress meant he was not nearly  ready  to  receive  the  Works  Item  despite  notifying  that  it  was  required  then  the Employer would, through the ER point out to the Contractor that he was not entitled to Works Items/instruction etc. until the item was actually required.  It might also be the case that the Programme provided is out of date, in which case until it is updated and provided by the  Contractor  it  would  be  his  actual  progress  that  would  apply.  However,  the  Employer should bear in mind that such circumstances could give rise to a dispute as the Contractor may well say that he is in fact ready for the information or the Works Item.

## Documents

## Reference sub-clause 4.12

The  Contractor  must  keep  all  relevant  documents  on  Site  including  contract documents.

<!-- image -->

The documents to be kept on Site include:

-  Instructions from the ER
-  Contractor's Documents
-  Details of all instructions and Contractor's Documents showing the dates of issue etc.
-  Where requested by the ER all publications named in the Contract and the Contractor's Documents.

## Example:

If a situation arose where the Employer became concerned that he was not being made aware by the ER of all instructions being issued to the Contractor (although this would be unlikely to  arise  in  practice)  he  could  insist  that  the  ER  authorise  him  to  inspect  the  Contractor's documents being kept on Site where, assuming the Contractor was in compliance with the requirements of sub-clause 4.11 he could assess all instructions provided by the ER and all Contractor's  Documents  (sub-clause  4.12)  together  with  a  log  of  instructions  showing  the dates of issue and subsequent revisions.

## Contractor's Management

## Reference sub-clause 4.13

The  Contractor  must  include  details  of  his  management  arrangements  in  the Works Proposals (sub-clause 4.13.2).

The  Contractor  is  obliged  to  implement  the  arrangements  and  change  them where necessary for efficiency (sub-clause 4.13).

The Contractor is obliged to keep the ER fully informed about its arrangements in  advance  and  about  their  implementation.      The  Contractor  is  obliged  to furnish  the  ER  with  all  information  necessary  to  enable  the  ER  to  perform  his powers and duties (sub-clauses 4.13.5 and 4.13.6).

The  Employer  should  ensure  that  the  ER  keeps  the  Employer  in  turn  fully informed about all of the Contractor's arrangements so that he is in a position to comment to the ER in relation to these where relevant.

## Communications

Reference sub-clause 4.14

All communications are to be interpreted purposefully.

This  means  that  in  interpreting  the  clauses,  the  spirit  of  the  Contract  and  its purpose and the purpose of the relevant sub-clause are to be used.  This is to get the parties and their representatives (including legal advisors) away from the old  ways  of  interpreting  provisions  by  simply  parsing  and  analysing  the  words (sub-clause 4.14.1).

<!-- image -->

It is also noteworthy that communications by email are recognised as well as the other more usual forms such as fax and post (sub-clause 4.14.3).

## Meetings

Reference sub-clause 4.15

The Contractor's Representative must attend meetings as scheduled by the ER He must arrange for any Contractor's Personnel to attend if requested by the ER.

The Employer could if he felt it was relevant and appropriate, have the ER invite him to certain site meetings particularly if issues of relevance to him were likely to be discussed.   This would of course depend upon the Employer's relationship with the ER and the information that the Employer is in receipt of from the ER. Of  course,  the  Employer  would  only  attend  such  a  meeting  for  information purposes and should not seek to give any instructions to the Contractor.

The Contractor is obliged also to notify the ER of any objection he has to the minutes issued by the ER within 5 working days of receiving them (sub-clause 4.15.2).

## Confidentiality

Reference sub-clause 4.16

The Employer must keep the Contractor's rates and prices and other records specified as confidential by the Contractor, confidential (sub-clause 4.16.2).

Note - the obligation  ceases  when  the  information  is  no  longer  commercially sensitive and in any event within 5 years from when the information was given.

## 14.5 Contractor's Personnel

## Contractor's Personnel

Reference sub-clause 5

The  Contractor  is made  specifically liable for all acts and omissions of Contractor's Personnel, including all Specialists and including their design work. (Sub-clause  5.1).  This  is  an  important  provision  in  that  it  removes  one  of  the problematic  issues  concerning  nominated  sub-contractors  whereby  a  main contractor was not liable for the design carried out by the sub-contractor.  Now the Contractor is fully liable as if the Specialist was a "domestic" sub-contractor. (sub-clause 5.1)

## Payment and Conditions of Employment

Reference sub-clauses 5.3, 11.4, Schedule (Part 1 J)

Copies of this very important sub-clause 5.3 must be prominently exhibited at the Site.

<!-- image -->

The Contractor must ensure that  rates  of  pay  and  conditions  of  employment comply  with  law  and  with  any  registered  employment  agreements  (sub-clause 5.3.2).

The Contractor himself must comply with and must ensure that the employers of all other work persons (i.e. subcontractors) comply with all of the obligations in clause 5.3.3(1) to (8).  This involves:

-  payment of all wages and other money due to work persons
-  making sure wages are paid in accordance with the Payment of Wages Act 1991 and are never more than a month in arrears
-  payment of all pension contributions and other amounts due to be paid on behalf of the relevant person
-  making all deductions from payments to work persons required by law and passing such deductions on as required by law
-  keeping proper records and producing them for inspection by the Employer whenever required
-  the  production  of  any  other  records  re.  rates  of  pay,  pension  and  other contributions for the Employer whenever required
-  respecting the legal right of work persons to be members of trade unions
-  observing all relevant safety law in relation to work persons on site and also Industrial  Relations  Act,  National  Minimum  Wages  Act  etc  (sub-clause 5.3.3).

The Contract may state that the Employer is entitled to make random checks. This will depend upon whether the Employer says in the Schedule part 1J that sub-clause 5.3.3A (2) is to be included in the Contract (sub-clause 5.3.3A (2)).

The Employer may request and if he does so, the Contractor must provide to him within 5 working days, a statement showing the wages and other payments due in respect of each work person working for the Contractor and, in respect of  work  persons  not  directly  employed  by  the  Contractor,  ensure  that  the relevant employer does the same.

If  the  Contractor  does  not  comply,  the  Employer  is  entitled  to  estimate  the amount  due  to  work  persons  and  to  deduct  it  from  payments  due  to  the Contractor until satisfied that the persons have been paid. (sub-clause 5.3.6)

The  Contractor  must  give  a  certificate  together  with  each  interim  statement stating that the requirements of payment to personnel etc. have been complied with in relation to the Works the subject of the interim certificate.   Failure to do  so,  or  to  comply  with  the  provisions  of  sub-clause  5.3  will  render  the Contractor  liable  to  the  Employer  for  any  investigation  costs  incurred.    In addition, no payment will be made to the Contractor for the work in question until the certificate is furnished (sub-clause 5.3.7 and 11.4.4).

See comments on this issue at 11.11 above.

## Example:

If  the  Employer  becomes  suspicious  at  any  stage  that  the  Contractor  is  not  in  compliance with his obligations in relation to payment and conditions of work persons he should request pursuant to sub-clause 5.3.3, the production of full wage records in relation to work persons as he is entitled to do pursuant to the contract. The Employer may, if he is entitled to do so, make a random check requiring production of records but even if he is not he is entitled to full  wage records of work persons as referred to above and is also entitled to a statement showing the amount of wages or other payments due in respect of each work person and if it is somebody employed by a Specialist or sub-contractor, the Contractor is obliged to ensure that that the Specialist or sub-contractor does the same.

If  the  information  is  not  forthcoming  then  the  Employer  should  estimate  the  amount  that should have been paid to the work persons in question together with contributions to their pension etc, deduct the estimated amount and hold it until satisfied that the proper amounts have been paid.

## Sub-Contractors and Specialists

Reference sub-clauses 1.1 and 5.4

The Contractor is not entitled to sub-contract all of the Works.

In civil  engineering contracts, the Contractor must submit details to the ER of any Sub-Contractors (ie, including any Specialists) that it proposes to use for any part  of  the  Works  (unless  provided  in  the  Contract  or  unless  the  Contract provides for other procedures).

The term "Specialist" is defined in the Contract as:

-  A Sub-Contractor or supplier of a Works Item named in the Contract
-  Contractor's personnel who do or are to do design
-  Contractor's personnel stated in the Works Requirements to be Specialists

Where Specialists or other Contractor's personnel are specifically named in the Contract,  the  Contractor  is  obliged  to  ensure  that  they  are  engaged  for  the work  in  question.    (They  would  be  named  by  the  Contractor  in  the  Works Proposal or, by the Employer in advance, in the Works Requirements.)

It  may  be  that  the  Specialist  named  in  the  Works  Requirement  is  already  in  a contractual  relationship  with  the  Employer  and  in  that  case  the  Employer  will novate that Specialist Contract to the Contractor.  In such a case, the Works Requirements must include a copy of the Contract between the Employer and the Specialist.  The Contractor must then accept the novation (transfer) and the Employer  and  the  Contractor  execute  the  Novation  Agreement  at  the  same time as the Contract Agreement (see Model Form 9).

Unless  a  Specialist  is  named  in  the  Contract,  the  ER  cannot  instruct  the Contractor to enter into a contract with that Specialist.

The  Contractor  is  not  entitled  to  allow  to  be  terminated  or  to  accept  a repudiation of his contract with a Specialist without first giving details to the ER.

<!-- image -->

An exception to this obligation is when the Specialist becomes insolvent or has committed a serious breach of health and safety law or has failed to put in place or to maintain the required insurances.

If the Contractor does terminate his Contract with a Specialist, he must replace the Specialist, having first submitted details of the proposed replacement to the ER.    There  is  an  entitlement  on  the  part  of  the  ER  to  object  to  he  proposed replacement if, in his view, the proposed replacement does not have at least the experience,  qualifications,  competence,  technical  capacity  and  financial  standing of the person he is replacing.

Where  a  collateral  warranty  is  required  from  a  Specialist,  that  should  be specified in the Schedule (Part 1F) with a certain date by which the Contractor must provide the warranty (see Model Form 10).

The  concept  of  the  Specialist  is  new.    Nominated  sub-contractors  are  now  replaced  by Specialists for whom the Contractor is fully responsible.  Specialists and the Specialist Works are to  be  set  out  in  the  Works  Requirements  or  in  the  Works  Proposals.    The  most  likely  and indeed  the  "default"  scenario  will  be  that  the  Contractor  will  provide  his  own  Specialists  in relation to specific Works Items and will be suitability assessed with those Specialists and will then include for them fully in the Contract Sum.

The engagement of a Specialist by the Employer in advance of the Contractor's engagement is unlikely to be the norm.  In the event of a novation, the Contractor will have provided in the Contract Sum for all work to be carried out by the Specialist for him.

## Example:

The  Contractor,  in  pre-qualifying  for  a  building  or  engineering  project,  includes  for  the carrying out of certain work by Specialists (say mechanical and/or electrical work) Subsequent to pre-qualification, the Contractor will include that Specialist in his Works Proposals and the full price for those Specialist works is included in the Contract Sum.  The administration of that Specialist is then entirely the responsibility of the Contractor so far as the Employer is concerned.

Alternatively, the Employer might decide, because of the long lead-in period for the Specialist works, to enter into a contract with the Specialist in advance of contracting with the Main Contractor.  The name of the Specialist and all documentation relating to the Specialist must be inserted into the Works Requirements for pricing by the Contractor.  The Contractor must then accept the transfer of that contract to him and the Contractor accepts all liability for the work carried out by that Specialist.

The  Employer  should  be  especially  careful  to  ensure  that  all  work  which  may  have  to  be carried  out  by  Specialists  is  considered  carefully  in  advance  of  the  Contract  and  the preparation  of  the  procurement  documentation  as  the  ER  is  not  entitled  to  instruct  the Contractor to engage a particular specialist where he is not named in the Contract.   In the event  that  the  Contractor  terminates  his  contract  with  a  Specialist  having  first  submitted details to the ER (or in circumstances where he is not required to furnish such details) the Contractor will replace the Specialist but must first submit details of the replacement to the ER.

<!-- image -->

In  the  above  circumstances the ER may object to the replacement for the reasons set out above  (Sub-clause  5.4.6),  in  which  case  the  Contractor  may  not  go  ahead  with  the appointment. If  the  circumstances  warranted  it,  at  a  future  date  the  ER  would  arguably  be within his rights (in consultation with the Employer) to direct the Contractor to remove the replacement from site if he was incompetent or if the ER was of the bona fide view that his presence on site was not conducive to safety, health or good order (sub-clause 5.6).  If this course of action was to be seriously considered the ER would have to give the Contractor an opportunity to allow the Specialist to perform and observe him so as to ascertain whether or not  such  circumstances  (warranting  his  removal  from  the  Site)  existed.  To  do  otherwise would arguably lead to a serious dispute with the Contractor.   The entitlement of the ER would arise from the fact that the term "Contractor's Personnel" includes Sub-Contractors and the term "Sub-Contractor" includes a Specialist.

## 14.6 Property Rights

## Infringement of Property Rights

## Reference Sub-Clause 6.2

The Contractor indemnifies the Employer against any breach of property rights including intellectual property rights by him arising from

-  the Contractor's performance or non-performance of the Contract (unless covered by the Employer's indemnity to the Contractor)
-  any  use  of  Works  Items,  Contractor's  Things,  temporary  works  by  the Contractor, the Contractor's Documents,  by  the  Contractor  or  the Contractor's Personnel (or by or on behalf of the Employer on termination of the Contractor's obligation to complete the Works
-  any  use  by  the  Employer  of  the  Works,  Works  Items  or  Contractor's Documents (for the purpose they were provided) (sub-clause 6.2.1)

The Employer indemnifies the Contractor in respect of liability from infringement of property rights because of the unavoidable use by the Contractor of the Works Requirements, Works Items or other items provided by Employer or the use or occupation of the Site for the Works which is the unavoidable result of carrying out the Works (sub-clause 6.2.2).

## Property and Rights in Contractor's Documents

Reference - sub-clause 6.4

As has been stated above [see the notes re Schedule part 1C at 11.4 above] the decision as to whether the Employer requires the copyright in all Contractor's Documents will be made in advance of the completion of Part 1 of the Schedule

The Employer states in the Schedule if property rights in documents is required (note - if not stated, the rights do not transfer).

Part IC of the Schedule in conjunction with sub-clause 6.4 of the Conditions allows the Employer the option of obtaining intellectual property rights in the

<!-- image -->

Contractor's Documents and Works Items.  It would be very important for the Employer to decide if he requires such a provision.  In a Design and Construct Contract it would obviously be of far greater significance than in a traditional type of contract.

## Example:

If it was the case that the Works the subject of the Contract were unique and if the Employer wished to protect that uniqueness or if they were the first in a series of such structures to be erected around the country (e.g. schools, railway stations etc.) then the Employer might well feel that it would be important for him to have the copyright in all documents and designs going forward.  However, the Contractor takes no responsibility for the use of the Contractor's Documents other than in connection with the Works. (sub-clause 6.4)

## 14.7 The Site

## Lands Made Available for the Works

Reference - clause 7

The Employer gives the Contractor a right to occupy the Site or relevant parts as provided for in Works Requirements on or before the latest of dates set out in sub-clause 7.1.1.

These are:

-  the Starting Date
-  the  day  after  the  Contractor  has  provided  all  the  things  he  is  obliged  to provide before the Starting Date
-  any date stated in the Works Requirements
-  the day after the Contractor submits his programme under sub-clause 4.8
-  the  date  stated  for  start  of  work  on  any  part  of  the  Site  in  the  current programme
-  the date the part of the Site is actually required.

The Contractor's right to occupy the Site is not absolute and is subject to whatever limits are inserted into the Works Requirements (sub-clause 7.1.2).

The  Contractor  is  not  entitled  to  exclusive  possession  of  the  Site  and  must facilitate  the  Employer and others as named in the Works Requirements (subclause 7.1.3).

The Contractor - once given occupation of the Site, is fully responsible for its security (including in relation to protestors and trespassers) and the safety of all persons entitled to be on it (sub-clauses 7.2 and 7.5).

The Contractor must ensure that the Works do not unnecessarily cause any nuisance or interfere with the use of adjacent lands (sub-clause 7.5.1).

<!-- image -->

The Employer for its part must ensure Employer's Personnel on site comply with the reasonable safety rules of the Contractor  as notified to them by him (subclause 7.5.2).

Where the Employer states it in the Works Requirements he may have work carried  out  on  Site  by  Employer's  personnel  and  the  Contractor  must  cooperate with them and co-ordinate their activities with his own (sub-clause 7.6).

The Contractor is responsible for setting out including rectification of errors that arise.  He must make all reasonable efforts to check information on setting out in the Works Requirements before himself setting out the Works (subclause 7.7).

If  the  Contractor  finds  fossils  or  archaeological  artefacts  or  items  of  value  or geological interest etc. on or adjacent to the Site he must not disturb them but must preserve them and notify the Employer (sub-clause 7.8).

The Contractor is responsible for all access routes to the Site and within it and for  their  maintenance.    He  must  take  all  reasonable  steps  to  ensure  that construction traffic does not damage roads, bridges or other property.  He must also provide all water and power on the Site (sub-clause 7.9).

On completion of the Works the Contractor must leave the Site in a proper condition (sub-clause 7.10).

The  permitted  working  times  for  the  Contractor  are  set  out  in  the  Works Requirements and he is confined to them except in cases of emergency or as may otherwise be agreed with the ER (sub-clause 7.11).

In civil engineering contracts the Contractor must pay charges for Site occupation (or occupation of any other place) or in relation to any Employer's facilities where provided for in the Works Requirements.  The Employer is entitled to deduct such charges from the Contractor's payments.  There is no such provision in the Building Works forms. (sub-clause 7.12).

## 14.8 Quality Control

## Standard of Workmanship

Reference - clause 8

In the traditional Contract the Contractor is obliged to ensure that the Works are executed and completed:

-  In accordance with the Contract (and as may be reasonably inferred from it); and
-  In a  proper  and  workmanlike  manner  using  good  practice  (sub-clause 8.1(1));
-  He is also obliged to ensure that all Works Items comply with the Contract and with the Legal Requirements, are of good quality and (unless otherwise

<!-- image -->

required under the Contract) new (it might be that the Contractor is to use recycled materials e.g. old slates or bricks) (sub-clause 8.1(2));

-  He is obliged to ensure that all materials and goods that are Works Items are fit for the purpose for which they would normally be used and that any Works Items selected or designed by the Contractor (including Specialists) are fit for their intended purpose in the Works (sub-clauses 8.1(3) and (4));

In  the  Design  and  Build  Form  the  Contractor  is  obliged  to  ensure  that  the Works are designed, executed and completed:

-  In accordance with the Contract (and as may be reasonably inferred from it); and
-  In a proper and workmanlike manner using good practice.
-  He is also obliged to ensure that all Works Items comply with the Contract and with the Legal Requirements and are new and of good quality (unless otherwise required under the Contract).
-  He is obliged to ensure that all materials and Works Items are fit for their intended purpose and that the completed Works are fit for their intended purpose as stated in or to be inferred from the Works Requirements (subclause 8.1).

The subtle difference in the wording as between the traditional Contract and the Design and Build Contract reflects the fact that where the Contractor is not carrying out the overall  design  he  should  not  have  the  obligation  of  fitness  for  purpose  of  the  overall Works.

These provisions are onerous obligations and the Employer should be familiar with them so as to be aware of what the Contractor is obliged to comply with.  The provision is as stated  above,  subtly  worded  and  means  that  in  the  Traditional  Contract  (unlike  the Design  and  Build    Contract)  while  the  overall  Works  are  not  the  Contractor's responsibility  from  a  design  standpoint,  any  Works  items  selected  by  him  are  in  the context of how they fit into the overall Works

The Contractor is obliged to establish a quality control system such as is required by the Works Requirements (sub-clause 8.2).

In this regard it is important for the Employer to ensure that such quality assurance procedures are inserted into the Works Requirements.

The ER is entitled to monitor, spot check and audit the Contractor's procedures in this regard (sub-clause 8.2).

The ER is entitled by virtue of Sub-Clause 8.3 to inspect by himself or anyone authorised by him the Works, or any place where Works Items are produced or stored for quality control purposes.

The Contractor is obliged to give any details requested by the ER in relation to the manufacture and supply of Works Items including any Test Certificates required.   He is also obliged to tell the ER before any Works Item is being covered up or where it is going to be made difficult or impossible to inspect and

<!-- image -->

to give the ER or his representative a reasonable opportunity to inspect (subclause 8.3).

The tests are to be set out in the Contract (in the Works Requirements or in the case of Contractor's Design, in the Works Proposals) and the Contractor is obliged to carry them out, agreeing the time and place with the ER and giving him an opportunity to attend.

In any event, the Contractor has to provide a certified copy of the test results (sub-clause 8.4).

Where any test fails, the Contractor may be required to repeat it or may elect to do so.   The Contractor is obliged to pay the Employer for any costs incurred as  a  result  of  retesting.      Once  a  defect  has  been  rectified,  any  test  on  the relevant  Works  Item  must  be  repeated  if  the  ER  requires  that  this  be  done (sub-clause 8.4).

Although a provision in relation to testing would not have been set out in the old forms, it would in  all  likelihood  have  been  contained  in  the  Preliminaries  section  of  the  BOQ  or  in  the Specification.

Provision is made at sub-clause 8.5 for the detection and remedying of defects in the  Works.    The  ER  may  instruct  the  Contractor  to  search  for  defects  or suspected defects including uncovering of any work etc.

If no defect is found, the cost of searching and any delay caused, will entitle the Contractor to an extension of time and to compensation. (sub-clause 8.5 and Schedule part 1K at item 2)

If  a  defect is made known to the ER because of investigations or otherwise he may tell the Contractor to:

-  Remove the Works Item with the defect from the site;
-  Demolish the defective Works Item if incorporated in the Works;
-  Reconstruct, replace, or correct the Works Item in question;
-  Not to deliver the defective Works Item to the site if relevant.

Or the ER may do any combination of the above. (sub-clause 8.5.2)

As would be the case under the older forms of contract should the Contractor fail to comply with a direction by the ER under sub-clause 8.5 within a reasonable time, the Employer is entitled to have the work done by others and the Contractor is obliged to pay for the costs of this. (sub-clause 8.5.3).

Should a defect be serious enough to deprive the Employer of the benefit of the entire Works or any particular Section or other material part of the Works, the ER may on behalf of the Employer reject the Works or the relevant Section and in that case the Contractor must repay to the Employer any amounts that the Employer has paid to the Contractor in respect of the Works (in the case of the entire)  or  relevant  part  together  with  all  relevant  associated  costs  (sub-clause 8.5.5).

<!-- image -->

This provision, while available under forms such as FIDIC, is a new one and in the rare cases where it might be used, could provide an important remedy, but subject to the ability of the Contractor to pay.

The ER may only give such a direction or rejection under sub-clause 8.5 before the Defects Certificate is issued (sub-clause 8.5.6).

There is further provision that a contractor is not entitled to any adjustment to the Contract Sum or to any extension of time because of a direction given to deal with any defect or breach of contract (sub-clause 8.5.6).

This would be perfectly normal in any of the previous forms of contract.

The Contractor must complete all outstanding works and remedy any Defects as are directed by the ER during the Defects Period.  He must do this as soon as practicable after Substantial Completion of the Works or of any Section (subclause 8.6.1).

The Contract provides that in the event of works remaining outstanding or repair work not having been carried out by the end of the Defects Period, the ER may extend the Defects Period for whatever length of time he regards as appropriate in the circumstances.  Similar considerations apply where the Contractor has carried out outstanding work or rectified defects during the Defects Period so that the Employer will have a full (or at least, extended) Defects Period in respect of the work in question (sub-clause 8.6.2).

Sub-clause 8.7 provides for the ER to issue the Defects Certificate to the Contractor and the Employer within 20 working days after the end of the Defects Period. However, the issue of the Defects Certificate does not relieve the Contractor of any responsibility for defects (unless they have been accepted by agreement under sub-clause 8.5.4).

## 14.9 Time and Completion

## Contract Date

Reference - The Agreement - Article 6, sub-clauses 1.1 and 9.1.1

The Contract Date is the Date of issue of the Letter of Acceptance (note therefore issue of LOA is important as it starts time running for the purpose of the Contract) (sub-clause 1.1).

## Start of the Works on Site

Reference - Letter of Appointment, Agreement - Article 6, the Schedule, subclauses 1.1, 9.1. and 12.1.1 - item (5).

The Starting Date is the date the Contractor intends to start the Works.

The Contractor must give at least 15 working days notice (unless a different period is stated in the Works Requirements or a shorter period is agreed with the ER) of the Starting Date (sub-clause 9.1).

<!-- image -->

The actual Starting Date must occur no later than 20 working days after the Contract Date unless otherwise stated in the Works Requirements (sub-clause 9.1.1).

## Example:

If the Letter of Acceptance issues in respect of the Contract on Friday 1 June 2007 that is the Contract Date (sub-clause 1.1 and Agreement - Article 6).  Unless otherwise stated in the Works Requirement.

The Contractor must give notice of the Starting Date by Friday 7 June (in order to give at least 15 working days notice)

The Starting Date must be by Friday 29 June (assuming no public holidays between 1  and 29 st th June)

Note: If  the  starting  date  does  not  occur,  the  Employer  may    terminate  the  Contractor's obligation to complete the Works (sub-clause 12.1.1)

The Contractor must hand over all required documents before the Starting Date (sub-clauses 9.1.2 and 4.9).

-  Agreement
-  Bond (if required)
-  parent company guarantee (if required)
-  appointment  as  PS(CS)  (if  Contractor  or  his  nominee  is  PS(CS)  plus developed health and safety plan (as per Construction Regulations)
-  evidence of insurance
-  collateral warranties (unless a later  date is agreed for their provision)
-  programme

The documents must all be executed where execution is relevant.

The Employer, along with the ER should make sure that all are properly executed and in an acceptable form.

This is not necessarily as straight forward as it might first appear.  As all these documents are required to be handed in by the Contractor before the Starting Date it is likely that in many situations they will be handed in either all at once or in circumstances which render the checking of them hurried and possibly difficult.  It is very easy to miss something that can later be crucial.   It will therefore be important that all documents are checked thoroughly.

Performance Bond (if required) - care should be taken to ensure that the Bond is in the correct form (Model Form 6). If it is in the correct form then the Employer must ensure that it has been properly executed and if it is a bond from a foreign entity that a letter from a qualified lawyer practicing in that jurisdiction is obtained in relation to its due execution and enforceability (in accordance with sub-clause 2.7). [The surety should be authorised to transact guarantee business in Ireland. This can be checked with the Financial Regulator].

<!-- image -->

Parent Company Guarantee (if required) - similar considerations relate to Parent Company Guarantees.  For instances, the Employer should be made aware in advance as to who the Parent Company is and should satisfy itself that that is in fact the parent company and should then satisfy itself that the guarantee being furnished is from that entity.   It should be in the correct form (Model Form 7) and the comments above in relation to due execution and enforceability apply.

With regard to the executed Appointment as PS (DP) or PS(CS) (Model Forms 9-11) if applicable - the comments in relation to appointment set out above apply.   Presumably if the Contractor has already executed the Agreement any considerations relating to execution on its part will have been raised at that stage and the Employer should take them into account.   It may be appropriate that the Employer should have the developed health and safety plan checked out by its own health and safety advisers to ensure that it is in compliance.

Evidence of insurance - it is absolutely vital that the Contractor has all of the insurances required by clause 3.   It will be essential for the Employer to satisfy himself whether by his own insurance advisers or otherwise that the policies are in place and that they are to cover the requisite liability.   For instance, that the Public Liability and Contractor's All Risks policies name the Employer and Contractor as co-insured, that the minimum indemnity limits are those contained in the Schedule part 1D, and that only the exclusions and the maximum excesses permitted in the Schedule (Part 1D) apply.

Collateral Warranties (where relevant) - it will be important for the Employer to check that the Collateral Warranties are provided (unless a later  date has been agreed) that they are in the correct forms, that they are properly executed.   In this regard it will be necessary to insist that where foreign companies are executing warranties that a legal opinion in accordance with subclause 2.7 is provided and that where the warranty is provided by an Irish entity that they are properly executed.

The Contractor is also obliged to appoint the Contractor's Representative and fulltime Site supervisor.

On the Starting Date - the Contractor is obliged to start work on site and proceed with the Works in accordance with Contract

## Substantial Completion

Reference - Agreement, Schedule part 1D, part 1E, part 1G, part 1H, part 1I, part 1K, part 2D

sub-clauses 1.1,  3.3, 4.5.3, 4.8.3, 4.9, 4.17, 8.6.1, 9.1, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.7, 11.1, 11.3, 11.5.

The Date for Substantial Completion is to be inserted by the Employer in the Schedule part 1G or (if required to be inserted by the Contractor) -in part 2D.

<!-- image -->

In order to insert the appropriate date in the Schedule the Employer will need to consider the Date for Substantial Completion of the Works (and each Section of the Works if there is to be sectional completion).

In this regard the Employer will doubtless consider the date by which the project is required, the practical issues associated with its (design and) construction, for instance, whether it is subject to matters such as tides (in relation to projects such  as  outfalls)  or  seasonal  issues  (perhaps  work  in  mountainous  or  boggy areas).

As there can be no compromise in relation to questions of Health and Safety it would be important where the Contractor is himself asked to insert the Date for  Substantial  Completion  that  the  Employer  consider  any  Health  and  Safety impact of this.  For instance it might be appropriate for the Employer to insert in the  Works  Requirements,  a  minimum  period  for  completion  based  upon  his estimate of what this should be in order to avoid any risks in respect of Health and Safety.

The Contractor must complete the Works (or Section) by the relevant Date for Substantial Completion.

The Date for Substantial Completion may be delayed as a result of Delay Events as set out in the Schedule (part 1K) subject to the provisions of the Contract. Where an extension of time is granted in accordance with the Contract, a new Date for Substantial Completion applies. (sub-clause 9.3.2)   Such an extension of time will apply to the Works and to any Section (if there is sectional completion) affected by the delay.

The  term  "Substantial  Completion"  is  very  comprehensively    defined  in  subclause 1.1

The Works are complete and can be taken over and used for their  purpose. There are no defects save:

-  Ones accepted by Employer (sub-clause 8.5.4)
-  Minor  defects
- -that do not prevent the use of the Works for their purpose
- -The  ER  agrees  that  the  Contractor  has  reasonable  grounds  for  not promptly fixing them
-  Those whose fixing will not prejudice safe and convenient use of the Works (or part)
-  All tests have been  passed  (that must  be  passed  before Substantial Completion)
-  Documents required before Substantial Completion have been furnished
-  Collateral  warranties  have  been  provided  in  relation  to  the  Works  or relevant part

While the Contractor's basic obligation to complete the works by the Date for Substantial Completion is no different to that in the old forms of contract, the

<!-- image -->

actual requirements that have to be fulfilled before Substantial Completion are perhaps set out more clearly than in the previously utilised forms.

In relation to Substantial Completion it would be necessary for the ER to satisfy himself fully that the Works are in fact substantially complete.   In this context it will be necessary for the Employer to decide in conjunction with the ER whether he will accept any defect with a proportional  reduction in the Contract Sum.

The Contractor applies for a Certificate of Substantial Completion and the ER must respond within 20 working days with:

-  a certificate of Substantial Completion; or
-  a list of reasons for not issuing the certificate

If  it  is  so  stated  in  the  Schedule  part  1H  -  the  ER  does  not  have  to  certify Substantial  Completion  before  the  actual  Date  for  Substantial  Completion  in Contract (sub-clause 9.6)

The Certificate may list outstanding work

## Right of Employer to Suspend Works

Reference sub-clause 9.2

The Employer has a right to suspend the Works - through an instruction of the ER

The Contractor must suspend and protect the Works

Upon the ER's direction to resume, the Contractor and ER inspect the Works and affected Works Items

Where the Contractor is entitled to an adjustment in the Contract Sum or to an extension of time because of the suspension - any cost of repairing Works Items unavoidably damaged and any delay in doing the repair is included

If  a  suspension  is  not  due  to  the  Contractor's  default  and  is  for  more  than  3 months - the Contractor may ask for permission to proceed

If no permission is forthcoming within 28 days Contractor may give notice to the ER as follows:

-  if  part  only  of  Works  affected  -  to  treat  the  suspension  instruction  as  a Change Order omitting the part
-  if the entire Works  is  suspended  the  notice  may  provide  that  the Contractor's obligation to complete the Works is terminated

The suspension of the Works by direction of the ER is both a Delay Event and Compensation Event.  (sub-clause 9.2 and Schedule part 1K)

<!-- image -->

## Example:

The Employer may encounter a situation where it is necessary to stop the Works proceeding pending  a  re-assessment  of  the  Works  Requirements  because  of  some  extraneous  event,  for instance, another project that is to link up with the Works and which may cause a substantial redesign of part of the Works.

In such a case the Employer could utilise sub-clause 9.2 and require the ER to issue a direction to the Contractor to suspend all or part of the Works.  The Employer should liaise closely with the ER and should ensure that the relevant dates are noted, for instance, when the period of three months from the ER's instruction will expire, when the Contractor may ask for permission to  proceed  and  particularly  when  the  period  of  28  days  will  expire  subsequent  to  any  such request for permission.

This is  to  avoid  a  situation  where  the Employer's default in responding to a request for such permission results in the Contractor's obligation to complete the Works being terminated or the relevant part of the Works being treated as omitted.

## Partial Takeover by Employer

Reference sub-clause 9.7

There is provision in the Contract for partial takeover of the works before substantial completion on 5 days notice to the Contractor.  The Contractor has no liability for delay in completing the relevant part once it is taken over.

## Example:

The  Employer  may  require  part  of  the  Works  as  a  matter  of  urgency  before  the  part  has achieved Substantial Completion.  In such a case the Employer might wish to consider partial take-over.  It is not a decision that should be taken lightly as it can cause difficulties particularly in relation to health and safety and in relation to insurances.  It would be necessary to ensure in conjunction  with  the  ER  and  the  Contractor  that  the  part  of  the  Works  in  question  can  be adequately defined so that there is no doubt as to which part is in fact being taken over.  For preference one would wish that the part to be taken over can be delineated precisely by means of  a  barrier  or  otherwise.      There  is  also  the  possibility  that  because  the  Contractor  will  no longer be liable for delay in completing the part, he may have no great desire to come back to finish it and this should be borne in mind when making the initial decision.  In addition, insurers should be notified so that no confusion is caused by the take-over.

## Liquidated Damages

Reference Schedule (part 1G) sub-clause 9.8.

See note re. Schedule (part IG at 11.8 above).

There  is  provision  in  the  Contract  for  the  deduction  of  liquidated  damages either in respect of the entire Works or any Section (or both) in the event that Substantial  Completion  is  not  achieved  by  the  required  date  for  Substantial Completion (sub-clause 9.8).

<!-- image -->

## Example:

The rate of liquidated damages per day or per week will be inserted by the Employer  in the Schedule part 1 G and in this regard the Employer should assess carefully the likely losses to be suffered by him should either a Section or ultimately the entire Works be delayed due to the Contractor's default.  In this regard the Employer should make sure that the amount in question is a genuine pre-estimate of actual losses in order to avoid the possibility that the damages may be unenforceable by reason of being a penalty.

In point of fact, many Employers insert liquidated damages that do not take into account all of their likely losses and accordingly such liquidated damages are too low.  In the case of Public Works contracts, while it may be difficult to accurately assess the precise damages that will be suffered,  nevertheless  an  attempt  should  be  made  taking  all  possible  areas  of  damage  into account such as interest on money borrowed. Obviously, the Employer should be aware of the risk of inserting a rate that is so high that it is a penalty.

There is also provision here for reduction in retention on substantial completion of a Section and in this  regard  the  Employer  should  consider the  relationship  that the  Section  in question bears to the overall works, for instance if the Section is a very substantial part of the Works and represents 25% of it in monetary terms then it may be appropriate to reduce the retention by a similar  percentage  once  that  Section  is  substantially  complete.    However,  other  factors  may come into play which would result in the reduction not being of similar proportions.

## Delays and Extensions of Time

Reference - Schedule (part 1K) sub-clauses 9.3 and 10.3.

The Contractor must give notice to the ER as soon as practicable of delay or likely delay to the Works.

The notice must specify:

-  the delay
-  the cause

## In addition

The  Contractor  must  as  soon  as  practicable  after  the  First  notice  and  in  any event within 40 working days after becoming aware of the delay, give the ER:

-  full details of the delay; and
-  its effect on progress

and

The Contractor must give further information to the ER as requested.

The contract provides, that if the Contractor has already given notice and details under sub-clause 10.3 as he is obliged to do in any event, he does not have to give further notice or details under  sub-clause 9.3  (sub-clause 9.3).

The  Contractor  is  entitled  to  an  extension  of  time  in  the  event  of  delay  in Substantial Completion due to a Delay Event where

<!-- image -->

-  the  delay  is  not  due  to  Contractor's  default  (  or  that  of  Contractor's Personnel)
-  the Contractor cannot avoid the delay
-  he has taken all reasonable efforts to minimise the delay
-  no provision in the Contract says that he has no entitlement

Only Site Working Days are taken into account.

Both the Contractor and ER must follow the procedures in clause 10 and the entitlement  to  an  extension  of  time  is  subject  to  the  provisions  of  clause  10 (sub-clause 9.3.2).

The  ER  can  revise  an  extension  of  time  but  can  only  bring  the  date(s)  for Substantial  Completion  of  the  Works  (or  any  Section)  forward  when  work  is omitted (and agreed with the Contractor).

It  is  important  to  note  that  there  is  scope  in  sub-clause  10.5.2  for  the  ER  to grant an extension of time under clause 9 even if the Contractor has not done so.

## Example:

## See Case Study Nr 3 - Delay and Compensation Events

The notice requirements in relation to delays and the granting of extensions of time are clearly set out in the Contract and the Delay Events which give rise to an extension of time are clearly set out in the Schedule.  The ER will be required to assess whether the Notice Requirements have been satisfied and whether the requisite information is being furnished by the Contractor before granting any extension to the Date for Substantial Completion.

## The ER will have to assess whether

-  there was a Delay Event
-  the Contractor has fulfilled his notice requirements
-  the Contractor is otherwise entitled to an extension of time in accordance with  sub-clause  9.3.2  and  that  the  procedures  in  clause  10  have  been followed

The ER will also have to consider very carefully whether, in the light of particular circumstances, he might wish to grant an extension of time despite the fact that no such extension has been sought by the Contractor (sub-clause 10.5.2).

## The Programme Contingency

Reference - Schedule (part 1K) sub-clause 9.4

The Programme contingency is provided for in the Schedule (part 1K).

The Employer provides in the Schedule for two (sequential) thresholds for delay in Substantial Completion due to certain Compensation Events.  The Contractor

<!-- image -->

prices these items and includes them in the initial Contract Sum and also in his programme.

If a delay is caused to the Date for Substantial Completion of the Works due to relevant Compensation Events but that delay remains below the first threshold the Contractor has no entitlement to an extension of time.

If  the  delay  due  to  relevant  Compensation  Events  exceeds  the  first  threshold then the ER deducts from that delay

- (i) the number of days stated in the first threshold,
- (ii) half the number of days delay in excess of the first threshold.

But the total number of days to be deducted at (ii) above cannot exceed the number of days in the second threshold.

## Example:

Thus if the Employer had inserted 20 days for first threshold and 30 days for second threshold in respect of a 60 day delay (due to relevant Compensation Events) the Contractor  would be entitled to a 20 day extension of time i.e.

60 days less 20 days (first threshold period) = 40 days ÷ 2 (to get half of the excess over the second threshold)= 20 days

As 20 days is less than the second threshold the figure of 20 days is also deducted

Therefore 60 days - (20 days + 20 days) = 20 days extension of time

On each assessment of extensions of time by the ER he must tell the Contractor how much of the Programme Contingency has been used up.

## Example:

In a situation where there was a delay of 100 site working days and assuming the first threshold was  20  days  and  the  second  threshold  was  30  days  the  calculation  of  any  extension  of  time would be as follows:

100 days less 20 days (first threshold) = 80 days ÷ 2 (to get half of excess over first threshold) = 40 days

As 40 days is greater than the second threshold, the second threshold of 30 days is used

Therefore 100 days - (20 days + 30 days) = 50 days extension of time

And see the examples in sub-clause 9.4.4

## 14.10 Claims and Adjustments to Contract Sum

## Contractor's Claims

Reference sub-clause 10

The Contractor must give notice to the ER.

The notice must state that it is given pursuant to sub-clause 10.3 of the Contract and must comply with the provisions of sub-clause 4.14.

<!-- image -->

Within a further 20 working days further details must be given as follows:

-  all relevant facts
-  a detailed calculation of the proposed adjustment to the Contract Sum
-  the amount of any other entitlement claimed
-  if  an  extension  of  time  is  relevant,  the  information  required  under  subclause  9.3  and  a  proposal  regarding  the  extension  and  any  use  of  the Programme Contingency

The Contractor must provide any additional information required by the ER.

Failure  to  give  notice  under  this  sub-clause  will  mean  the  Contractor  has  no entitlement to the extension of time or adjustment sought (sub-clause 10.3.2 and see sub-clause 10.5.2).

The requirements in relation to strict notice do not apply where the Contractor has complied with a request for a proposal pursuant to sub-clause 10.4.

Where  there  is  a  continuing  delay/cost  the  Contractor  must  update  the information on a monthly basis as follows:

-  setting  out  the  extension  of  time  and  adjustment  to  the  Contract  Sum sought
-  proposing a final adjustment to the Contract Sum and Date for Substantial Completion
-  providing any other reasonably required information (sub-clause 10.3.3)

The Contractor must keep detailed records of the event giving rise to the delay and adjustment to the Contract Sum.  These must include any records required by the ER.

The Contractor must give the records to the ER if directed to do so (sub-clause 10.3.4).

## Proposed Instructions

Reference sub-clause 10.4

The  ER  can  require  the  Contractor  to  furnish  proposals  in  relation  to  any proposed instruction. The Contractor must respond with 20 working days after being required to do so. The response must include:

-  details of any adjustment to the Contract Sum likely to result
-  information on any likely delay as required under clause 10
-  a  proposal  for  using  the  Programme  Contingency  or  for  an  extension  of time
-  if there is a proposal to omit work a revised programme and if appropriate, a proposal re an earlier date for Substantial Completion

<!-- image -->

-  any Contractor's Documents needed in relation to the proposed instruction or a timeline for their production

## Employer's Representative Determination

Reference sub-clause 10.5

The ER has 20 working days within which to respond to any Contractor's claim or proposal under sub-clauses 10.3 or 10.4.

## The ER must:

-  direct  the  provision  of  additional  information  (the  Contractor  has  10 working days and the ER another 10 working days after that [subject to the ER not requiring any more information or proposals] to respond)
-  notify the Contractor that his proposals are agreed (and make any required adjustment  to  the  Contract  Sum,  grant  an  extension  of  time  or  use  the programme contingency)
-  assess  any  adjustments  to  the  Contract  Sum,  the  use  of  the  programme contingency or extension of time and notify the Contractor
-  if a proposal has been made by the Contractor under clause 10.4 notify him that the instruction in question will not be given

The Contract also provides that the ER may make his own determination on any extension  of  time,  use  of  the  programme  contingency  or  adjustment  to  the Contract Sum despite the Contractor not having made any claim or proposals under sub-clauses 10.3 or 10.4.  This is a very important potential relaxation of the otherwise exacting provisions of the Contract in relation to notice of claims. It will arguably impose an added responsibility on the ER to decide in each case where  he  feels  an  extension  of  time  or  adjustment  to  the  Contract  Sum  is appropriate, whether or not to grant it where the Contractor would otherwise have lost his entitlement because of a failure to give notice.

Where a proposal is sought by the ER under clause 10.4 the Contractor is not entitled to implement such an instruction until confirmed by the ER.

<!-- image -->

## See Case Study Nr 3 - Delay and Compensation Events

As  with  extensions  of  time,  the  notice  requirements  in  relation  to  Contractor's  claims  and adjustments to the Contract Sum are exacting but once again are clearly set out in clause 10, which also provides for notice requirements in relation to extensions of time (see sub-clause 10.3.1).  The ER upon receipt of such notice will be obliged to deal with it in a very systematic, efficient and transparent manner.   It would be incumbent upon the ER in conjunction with the Employer  to  set  up  a  system  for  dealing  with  such  claims  so  that  they  can  be  responded  to promptly and fully.   As with notices of delay the ER will have to assess whether or not the Contractor is prime facia entitled to an adjustment to the extension of time/Contract Sum or any  other  entitlement  claimed,  and    to  assess  whether  or  not  he  has    provided  all  details required under the Contract and within the relevant periods.   In this regard the ER will be well aware  that  the notice requirements  under  clause  10  are  conditions  precedent  to  the Contractor's entitlement.

Thus, if  the  Contractor fails to give notice in accordance with the sub-clause he will have no entitlement to the extension of time or adjustment unless the ER uses his discretion under subclause 10.5.2.   It is possible that the Contractor may have fulfilled the requirements by means of a proposal in relation to a proposed instruction pursuant to clause 10.4 and the ER will have to be mindful of this.

The ER will need to keep careful sight of all details of continuing delay and cost received from the Contractor, should have a firm and reasoned opinion on them and must be mindful of the fact  that  he  himself  is  subject  to  a  20  working  day  period  within  which  to  respond  to Contractor's claims under sub-clause 10.3 or proposals under sub-clause 10.4.   The ER will also have to keep in focus in relation to delay claims the use of the programme contingency so that it can be used where appropriate and the Contractor can be notified of the fact of its use and of the remaining amount of the contingency.

Where a Compensation Event delays the carrying out of the Works so as to push the Contract into  a  consecutive  period  of  7  or  more  non-working  days  that  would  not  otherwise  have occurred  the  Contractor  is  entitled  to  compensation  in  respect  of  his  expenses  exclusive  of profit or loss of profit.   This is to be included in addition to the Contract Sum for the delay cost.    However,  the  ER  in  assessing  the  amount  should  note  that  the  amount  to  be  paid  in respect  of  the  non-working  days  is  not  to  exceed  the  sum  arrived  at  by  multiplying  the Contractor's tendered rate of delay cost by the non-working days being compensated for.

It should be noted that a non-working day is defined as "a day that, for good reason, is not a Site Working Day [such as a trade holiday.]"

In  a  case  where  the  Contractor  is  required  to  and  does  provide  in  the  Schedule  Part  2  in respect of delay costs for parts of the Works then of course the rate quoted for the portion of the Works when the delay occurred is to be used as assessed by the ER.

## Assessment of Adjustments to the Contract Sum

Reference - Schedule (part 1K) and (Part 2E) sub-clause 10.6

Adjustments  to  the  Contract  Sum  due  to  Compensation  Events  are  made  in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause 10.6 as follows.  Where there is additional, substituted or omitted work

-  the rates in the Pricing Documents are to be used where the work is similar and executed under similar conditions to those priced

<!-- image -->

-  the rates in the Pricing Documents are to be used as a basis of assessment where the work is not similar to that  priced  or  is  not  carried  out  under similar conditions
-  a fair valuation is to be made by the ER where the above do not apply

Alternatively, the ER may direct that any additional or substituted work is valued by reference to the actual cost of performing the work as follows:

-  the hours worked by each work person as identified by the Schedule (parts 1K and 2E) multiplied by the rate for that category of work person as per the Schedule (part 2E)
-  the  cost  of  materials  used  plus  the  percentage  adjustment  of  that  cost  as tendered  and set out in the Schedule (part 2E)
-  the cost of plant used at rates in the document set out in the Schedule (part 1K) - if no rate in the Schedule - market rental can be used - adjusted per the adjustment provided for in the Schedule (part 2E)

The Schedule Part 1 plays a role in assessing adjustments to the Contract Sum by identifying Compensation Events.  The Pricing Document has an even more crucial role in providing the rates pursuant to which varied work will be paid for. The Pricing Document is to be used where it contains rates applicable to the additional, substituted or omitted work.   If the nature of the work carried out is different to that in the Pricing Document the ER will use those rates as the basis for his evaluation.  Otherwise he is to make a fair valuation which presumably would be based upon rates  for  similar  work  in  the  locality  carried  out  under similar conditions.

The ER is also entitled to direct that such additional or substituted work is assessed on a cost plus basis (time and materials) by reference to the rates provided for by the Contractor in the Schedule part 2E).

The Contractor is obliged to provide a rate for crafts persons, general operatives and apprentices in the Schedule (part 2E) which will include for PRSI, benefits, tool money, travelling time and country money.  This is the rate that may be used by the ER in calculating payment for additional or substituted work pursuant to sub-clause 10.6.4.   In addition the Contractor is to provide in the Schedule (part 2E) his tendered percentage addition in respect of the cost of materials and his tendered percentage addition (or deduction) for the costs of plant inclusive of on-costs, overheads and profit exclusive of V.A.T.

The ER may use the cost of relevant materials together with the percentage in the Schedule part 2E in valuing materials.

It should be noted that if the Contractor leaves his tendered percentage additions/deductions blank or states them as a zero then these are read as zero.

<!-- image -->

## Assessment of Delay Cost

Reference - Schedule part 1K and 2E and sub-clause 10.7

Where delay to the Date for Substantial Completion arises from a Compensation Event, delay cost as inserted by the Contractor in the Schedule (part 2E) is added to the Contract Sum.

Alternatively,  depending  on  whether  or  not  the  Employer  has  selected  this option when completing the Schedule part1 K, the Contractor's actual expenses unavoidably incurred are to be used.

If  the  delay  cost  option is chosen by the Employer, the Contractor's tendered rate of delay costs is to be provided by him at tender stage (in the Schedule part 2E) in accordance with the instruction contained in the Schedule part 1K.

An important point of note is that for periods of concurrent delay - there will be no increase in the Contract Sum if one of the causes of a delay is not a Compensation Event (sub-clause 10.7.2).

The subject of liability for concurrent delays in construction has been the subject of much debate in the past.  The provision in the Contract makes it clear that concurrent delays (i.e. periods of delay  for  which  there  are  more  than  one  cause)  will  not  be  compensated  unless  all  are Compensation Events. This can be argued for on the basis that there is in fact no net delay for which the Employer has agreed to adjust the Contract Sum  While it is unlikely that a contractor would seek an extension of time due to a cause that was not a Compensation Event where such delay was concurrent with a "compensatable delay", the ER ensure that extensions are granted for such causes, using the discretion under sub-clause 10.5.2 if necessary.

## Example:

For instance, if the same period of delay is due to a combination of the failure by the Employer to  give  the  Contractor  a  Works  Item  or  other  thing  required  by  the  Contractor  after  the Contractor has asked for it (sub-clause 4.10) [both a Delay Event and a Compensation Event] and  say,  a  weather  event  as  defined  in  the  Schedule  Part  IK  [a  Delay  Event  but  not  a Compensation  Event]  then  the  Contractor  would  not  be  entitled  to  any  increase  in  the Contract Sum for that period of concurrent delay.

In the event that a Compensation Event results in a holiday period of 7 or more consecutive working days being included in the extended Contract period the Contractor's expenses (excluding profit and loss of profit) unavoidably incurred are included in the assessment of the Contract Sum adjustment subject to the following:

-  the  amount  added  to  the  Contract  Sum  must  not  exceed  the  amount calculated by multiplying the Contractor's tendered rate of delay cost by the additional non-working days (sub-clause 10.7.3)

The provisions  in  sub-clause  10.7  are  exhaustive  of  the  Contractor's  rights  of recovery  in  respect  of  loss  or  expense  from  delay  or  disruption,  loss  of productivity etc (sub-clause 10.7.4).

No delay costs  are  payable  in  respect  of  extension  of  time  for  completion  of Sections.

<!-- image -->

The Schedule at part 1K requires the Contractor to tender in part 2E either a single rate for delay costs or, if required to do so, a separate rate for delay costs for various portions of the Works.   The Contractor sets out the tendered delay costs in the Schedule at part 2E.   These are rates per Site Working Day but excluding VAT.

When the ER is calculating the adjustment to the Contract Sum in respect of the delay  caused  by  the  Compensation  Event,  he  uses  the  Contractor's  tendered rate of delay costs to calculate the compensation in question.

As can be readily appreciated, the insertion by the Contractor of a delay rate in the Schedule and its use by the Employer in compensating for relevant delays that may occur, greatly simplifies the entire process of payment for delays to a contract.  When taken in conjunction with the provision in sub-clause 10.7.4 to the effect that the Contractor has no other entitlement for delays, it should act so as to avoid global and other claims for prolongation of contracts that have dogged the industry over the years.

## Employer's Claims

Reference sub-clauses 10.9 and 11.4

The Contract now expressly provides for the making of claims by the Employer against the Contractor.

Where the Employer or ER considers the Contract Sum ought be adjusted in favour of the Employer or that a sum is due by the Employer to the Contractor

-  the Employer or ER must give notice of the event to the Contractor (and the other)

The notice must include:

-  the details and facts giving rise to the claim
-  a calculation of the amounts in question and a proposal of the adjustment to the Contract Sum

The Contractor has 20 working days to respond.

Within  a  further  20  working  days  (or  if  no  response  is  received  from  the Contractor, within 20 working days from the expiry of the initial 20 day period) the ER determines the matter.

The Employer is entitled to deduct from any money due to the Contractor

-  any amount determined by the ER as due to him by the Contractor or likely to become due under the Contract
-  any  sum  due  to  him  from  the  Contractor  under  any  contract  (sub-clause 10.9.3)

<!-- image -->

If the  Employer  becomes  aware  of  a  claim  that  he  may  have  against  the Contractor  it  will  be  important  for  him  to  liaise  with  the  ER  in  this  regard. Likewise if the ER considers that the Employer is entitled to claim monies from the Contractor it would be incumbent upon him to discuss the matter with the Employer and to assess whether or not such a claim is to be made.  For instance, if  the  Contractor  has  not  provided  a  Collateral  Warranty  on  time  then  the amount referred to in sub-clause 11.4.1 and set out in the Schedule (Part IF)    is due from the Contractor to the Employer pursuant to sub-clause 11.4 and this will  be  referred  to  in  the  notice.    The  notice  should  also  include  a  clear calculation and the proposed adjustment to the Contract Sum.

Once  the  Contractor  has  responded  within  the  20  working  days  time  limit available  to  him  under  sub-clause  10.9.2  the  ER  makes  his  determination  and once that determination has been made, the Employer is entitled to deduct the amount determined (if any).

If the  Contractor  was  for  instance  carrying  out  another  contract  for  the Employer  elsewhere  and  substantial  amounts  are  due  to  the  Employer  under that  Contract  then  the  Employer  is  also  entitled  to  deduct  such  an  amount pursuant to sub-clause 10.9.3.

The ER will  have  to  ensure  that  in  making  any  determination  of  sums  due  or likely to become due by the Contractor to the Employer, he is careful that no injustice is done to either party.

## 14.11 Payment

## Interim Payment

Reference - Schedule part 1L and sub-clause 11

Interim payments arise:

-  at the periods for interim payments in the Schedule (part 1L) (provided the minimum payment amount in the Schedule is reached)
-  on the issue of the Certificate of Substantial Completion for the Works or a Section (sub-clause 11.1.1)

On these occasions the Contractor must provide a statement to the ER showing

-  the progress of the Works
-  the payment he says is due
-  a detailed breakdown of the sum
-  any supporting evidence the ER requires
-  a certificate pursuant to clause 5.3.7 (that the Contractor has complied with clause 5.3 in relation to the work, the subject matter of the certificate)
-  on Substantial Completion - all amounts due on the Works or Section (see sub-clause 11.5.1 in this regard)

<!-- image -->

## The Contractor is entitled to be paid

-  the Contract value of Works properly executed
-  any amount due for unfixed Works Items
-  any amounts due for Compensation Events
-  any amounts due for PV1 or PV2 (whichever is part of the Contract) (sub-clause 11.1.2)

The ER must provide a payment certificate within 10 working days (with copy to Employer) stating the amount the ER says is due including Employer's claims and liquidated damages  with  calculations and  reasons  for the amount  in  the certificate.

The Contractor must furnish an invoice to the Employer who must pay within 15 days from receipt of the invoice by him.

## Example:

Assuming the period for interim payment is confirmed as being monthly and assuming that the minimum amount for interim payments has been reached the Contractor submits his interim account to the ER in the normal way.

The ER calculates the amount to which the Contractor is entitled noting that the works must be properly executed and calculating the value based on the Pricing Document.  In addition the ER will add in any amount the Contractor is entitled to be paid for Unfixed Works Items up to the percentage stated in the Schedule part IL.  If there are any adjustments to be made to the Contract Sum for Compensation Events (i.e. for additional or substituted work under sub-clause 10.6 and/or delay costs under sub-clause 10.7) then these will be added together with any amount in respect of price variations.

The Employer will then received a copy of the Payments Certificate which has been issued to the Contractor (within 10 working days of the Contractor's statement) and an invoice based on the amount of that Payment Certificate.  The Employer will have 15 days within which to pay the amount due falling which the Employer will become liable to interest at the rate provided in the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations, 2002.

Retention may also be deducted by the Employer from the payments to be made - see notes on retention below (sub-clause 11.3).

It may be seen from the above that the timeframe for certification and payment is very tight.  This will require clear lines of communication between all relevant parties so as to ensure there are no problems with payment to Contractors.

## Unfixed Work Items

Reference sub-clause 11.2

The ER has a discretion to include in Interim Payments amounts in respect of unfixed Works Items up to a maximum percentage of their value as set out in the Schedule (Part 1L) (the default is 90%).

<!-- image -->

Payment for unfixed Works Items is subject to certain qualifications:

-  They are complete and substantially ready for incorporation in the Works
-  Title has been vested in the Employer
-  They are stored on the Site
-  They have not been brought onto the Site prematurely

If  the  Works Items have not been delivered to the Site following qualifications apply:

-  They are complete and substantially ready for incorporation
-  Title has been vested in the Employer
-  They have been properly stored, set aside and clearly marked to show they are destined for Site and are the property of the Employer
-  They  must  be  clearly  identified  and  a  list provided  to  the  ER  with documentary evidence that title is vested in the Employer
-  They must be insured as required under the Contract (including insurance in transit)

A  bond  must  be  provided  to  the  Employer  in  the  form  in  the  Works Requirements or in an approved form in respect of the amount to be paid.

It  is  essential  that  the  ER  is  rigorous  in  ensuring  that  any  unfixed  Works  Items,  which  he  is considering including in an interim payment comply with all of the provisions of sub-clause 11.2 as the Employer may be incurring risk needlessly if the provisions are not complied with.  For instance, the risk that the supplier becomes insolvent and the goods are not released or that there is an argument in relation to their ownership, or risk of damage being caused either when stored or in transit, which is not adequately insured.

## Retention

Reference Sub-clause 11.3

The percentage for retention by the Employer is set out in the Schedule (part IL).

The  Employer  is  entitled  to  deduct  the  retention  percentage  from  Interim Payments.

At Substantial Completion the Contractor is entitled to invoice for and to be paid half of the retention and the remaining half is paid upon the issue of the Defects Certificate.

However, the Contractor may provide a retention bond (in the form contained in the  Model Forms - Form 17 or in an approved form) and where he does so within 10 working days of Substantial Completion he is entitled to invoice for and be paid the balance of the retention money.

Similar considerations for repayment of retention apply in the case of Sections of the Works.

Where a retention bond is being provided similar considerations are applicable to the provision of  a  performance bond.  This means that the employer should ensure that the bond is in the appropriate  form  (see  Model  Forms  -  Form  17  (which  should  be  contained  in  the  Works Requirements and if not contained in the Works Requirements, the Employer will need to vet the form to ensure that it is a satisfactory form.  In this regard it might be appropriate to either have it  approved by the Employer's legal advisers or at the very least to compare it with the form in the Model Forms.

## Status of Payments to Contractor

Reference sub-clause 11.4

Payments are stated to be for compliance in full with Contractor's obligations to the date of payment

If the Contractor has not complied in full with his various obligations - there is no  obligation  on  the  Employer  to  pay  in  full.    The  Contract  provides  for  the deduction or withholding of  money from the Contractor  under a number of headings.

-  if  collateral warranties are not provided in time (i.e. by the date set out in the  Schedule  for  their  provision)  -  the  Employer  may  deduct  the  amount shown in the Schedule and hold it until the warranty is furnished
-  if a programme or progress report under sub-clauses 4.9 and/or 4.10 is not provided in time - the Employer may deduct 15% of any payments due until it is furnished
-  if the Contractor has not complied with the requirements of sub-clause 5.3 re  proper  payments  to  work  persons  -  the  Employer  may  estimate  the amount  due  to  such  work  persons  and  deduct  it  until  satisfied  with  the situation
-  if the Contractor does not provide a certificate as required with his interim statement that all work persons have been properly paid in respect of the relevant  work  -  the  Employer  may  withhold  payment  for  the  (estimated labour  element  of  the)  relevant  work  until  receipt  of  the  certificate  The Contractor is obliged to give  the  Employer  any  necessary  information  for the estimation of the labour element  (sub-clause 11.4)

Any deductions made as above are deducted from the Contract Sum if there has been no compliance by the date of issue of the Defects Certificate

When the Employer is making payment to the Contractor he should have from the ER a clear record of whether or not the Contractor is in compliance with his obligations to provide Collateral Warranties, the programme and progress reports.  The Employer should also make sure that the ER is informing him as to whether the Contractor has provided the Certificate required with sub-clause 5.3.7 (relating to proper payment of work persons) with his interim statement. With regard to the provisions of clause 5.3 it is intended that the Contractor himself will police the payment of all relevant work persons and the certification under sub-clause 5.3.7 is part of this process.  However, the Contract provides at sub-clause 5.3.3(A)(2) when included by means of the Schedule (part 1J) for

<!-- image -->

random checks by the Employer  and it is the policy of the Government that such checks are to be made.

## Example:

If a payment has been certified in a certain amount and the Employer is aware that the Contractor has not provided a collateral warranty by the date stated in the Schedule (part 1F) then the Employer may deduct the amount due pursuant to the Schedule (part 1F) until that warranty has been provided.   Similarly, in respect of the other items which the Contractor is required to give and in respect of which the Employer is entitled to deduct monies.

It is noteworthy that in relation to the Certificate to be provided by the  Contractor pursuant to sub-clause5.3.7 to the effect that work persons have been properly paid, unless the Contractor provides the Certificate the Employer may deduct the entire payment in respect of the Work Item in question and may ultimately permanently withhold the labour portion of the amount in question.

The Employer will then received a copy of the Payments Certificate which has been issued to the Contractor (within 10 working days of the Contractor's statement) and an invoice based on the amount of that Payment Certificate.  The Employer will have 15 days within which to pay the amount due falling which the Employer will become liable to interest at the rate provided in the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002.

While the certification provisions envisage that sums due from the Contractor to the Employer are taken into account in the interim Payment Certificates (although the wording of sub-clause 11.1.2 might lead one to believe otherwise) it does appear from sub-clause 11.4 that even if they were not, the Employer may deduct the relevant sums under sub-clause 11.4.

## Final Payment to Contractor

## Reference sub-clause 11.5

The  Contractor  must  submit  a  final  statement  within  2  months  of  Substantial Completion of the Works.

The final statement must include all sums the Contractor says are due under or in connection with the Contract (sub-clause 11.5.1).

The  Employer  has  no  liability  for  matters  not  set  out  in  the  final  statement except for:

-  matters  arising  under  the  indemnity  provisions  in  the  Contract  (such  as insurance claims), or
-  Compensation Events that occur after Substantial Completion

The  ER  must  within  three  months  of  receipt  of  the  final  statement  issue  a penultimate payment certificate indicating the amount due from the Employer to the Contractor (or vice versa) less final retention.

The ER must then issue a final payment certificate as soon as practical and no later than three months after the Defects Certificate issues stating the amount finally due from the Employer to the Contractor (or vice versa).

<!-- image -->

The  final  payment  certificate  amount  will  be  the  same  as  the  penultimate certificate amount except that it will include:

-  The final retention payment
-  Any  adjustments  to  the  Contract  Sum  arising  from  Compensation  Events occurring after Substantial Completion
-  Amounts owed by the Contractor to the Employer not already included in penultimate  payment certificate (e.g. for defects not remedied)
-  Any  deductions  from  the  Contract  Sum  arising  from  Contractor's  default (failure to provide documents etc)

The  Contractor  issues  an  invoice  in  respect  of  any  sums  due  on  foot  of  the penultimate or final payment certificates and the Employer must pay within 15 days after receiving the invoice.

Note: The payment of certificates whether interim, penultimate or final do not relieve the Contractor of its obligations under the Contract or provide evidence that the work has been executed properly.

The final payment process is a relatively straightforward one.   For example, the Employer  will  receive  in  the  first  instance  the  penultimate  payment  certificate from  the  ER  which  will  set  out  the  amount  due  by  the  Employer  to  the Contractor (assuming that there is money due).   The Employer will then receive an invoice from the Contractor in respect of the amount due on the invoice and is  obliged  to  pay  it  within  15  working  days.    Alternatively  if  the  penultimate payment certificate indicates that the Contractor owes money to the Employer then the Employer should make a demand upon the Contractor in respect of the amount whereupon the Contractor is obliged to pay within 10 working days of receipt of that demand.

The  Employer  will  expect  to  receive  from  the  E.R  a  final  payment  certificate showing the final amount due to the Contractor (or vice versa) within 3 months after the issue of the Defects Certificate.  This certificate will constitute the final payment to be made by the Employer to the Contractor

The Employer must pay the amount due on foot of the final payment certificate within  15  working  days  of  receiving  an  invoice  in  this  respect  from  the Contractor  failing  which  he  will  become  liable  to  pay  interest  at  the  rate provided in the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002.

## Time for Payment

Reference sub-clause 11.6

Unless a specific time is stated any amount due is to be paid within 30 (calendar) days of receipt of the relevant demand.

Practically all payments to be made under the Contract appear to be provided for with a specific time being stated - i.e. 15 days or 10 days

<!-- image -->

Interests pursuant to the Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 applies to late payment.

## 14.12 Termination

## Termination on Contractor Default

Reference clause 12

The  Contract  provides  for  termination  of  the  Contractor's  obligation  to complete the Works for default and for termination without any default on the part of the Contractor (sub-clauses 12.1.1 and 12.5)

Reasons for termination for default are:

-  Failure by Contractor to comply  with contractual obligations (in the case of defaults that can be corrected, failure to do so within 14 days from receipt of direction in this regard)
-  Abandonment  or  suspension  (unless  permitted  by  the  Contract)  of  the Works
-  Failure to proceed regularly and diligently with the Works
-  Failure to provide or maintain insurances or Bond
-  Failure to commence work within 6 weeks of the date required under the Contract or failure to initiate a Starting Date
-  Contractor's warranties (any of them) are not true
-  A serious breach of Legal Requirements (including labour law) concerning the Works
-  Breach of safety law or codes of practice concerning the Works
-  Failures  relating  to  payment  of  work  persons  either  persistently  or  within 14 days after notice from the Employer to rectify the matter
-  Sub-Contracting in breach of Contract
-  Insolvency as set out in the Contract
-  Incapacity (in the case of an individual) (sub-clause 12.1)

Where  the  Contractor  consists  of  more  than  one  entity  or  person  and  an insolvency event occurs in relation to one of them the Employer may:

-  Terminate the Contractor's obligation to complete the Works or
-  Only terminate the obligation of the person concerned leaving the others liable  for  performance  of  the  Contract  (including  that  of  the  defaulting Contractor)

<!-- image -->

The  Employer  may  also  terminate  if  there  is  a  failure  on  the  part  of  the Contractor to provide a replacement Guarantor and guarantee where the initial Guarantor becomes insolvent or the guarantee becomes unenforceable

-  The  replacement  Guarantee  or  Guarantor  must  be  provided  within  10 working days of the event giving rise to the replacement.

## Example:

If the Contractor is in default of its obligations under the Contract e.g. failing to proceed with the execution of the Works and failing to repair defective workmanship or otherwise failing to comply  with  obligations  under  the  Contract,  the  Employer  should  be  kept  informed  of  such matters by ER   It would be necessary for the Employer and ER possibly subject to receipt of legal advice to assess precisely which of the provisions of sub-clause 12.1.1 that the Contractor is failing to comply with.   It is likely that if the question of termination is being contemplated at all, that the matter has been going on for quite some time.

If  however the Employer is indeed seriously contemplating termination then he should discuss the matter in depth with the E.R and possibly with his legal adviser so that the correct approach is taken.  For instance, if the matter is one which can be rectified then it would be essential for the ER to issue a formal direction to the Contractor to put the matter right and in this regard it would be useful to formally state that if the matter is not rectified within 14 days, the Employer intends to exercise his right to terminate the Contractor's obligation to complete the Works. The Contractor should then be given the 14 days within which to put the matter right and only if  he has not done so within that period should the Employer serve notice on the Contractor pursuant to sub-clause 12.1 terminating his obligation to complete the Works.   Legal advice should be sought upon the format of the notice but in essence it must be clear and unequivocal and preferably should state precisely what it is and the fact that it is a notice pursuant to subclause 12.1 of the Contract.  The notice should be sent in strict accordance with the provisions of  sub-clause 4.14 and to the person named in the Schedule part 2A.

It  would  also  be  important  for  the  Employer  and  the  ER  to  consider  the  position  under  the Bond  or  Bonds  that  have  been  provided  by  the  Contractor  and  whether  notification  of  the bondsman is appropriate (which is likely).

If the Contractor persistently fails to honour his obligations to pay work persons properly then the Employer is entitled to serve notice of termination without the 14 day notice.  Similarly, if an Insolvency Event as defined in sub-clause 12.1.1 occurs then the Employer may serve a notice of termination without any further notice.

## Consequences of Termination for Default

Reference sub-clause 12.2

The  consequences  of  termination  for  default  are  set  out  in  clause  12.2  and include:

-  The Contractor must leave the Site and not remove any Works Items or Contractor's Things unless directed to do so
-  Payments are postponed
-  The ER makes an assessment (as soon as practical) of the amount due in respect of work done and not yet paid (the "termination value")

<!-- image -->

-  The  Employer  engages  other  contractors  to  use  the  Works  Items  and Contractor's Things on the Site to complete the Works
-  The Contractor must assign sub-contracts and supply contracts etc. to the Employer where directed to do so
-  The Employer has discretion to pay sub-contractors or suppliers amounts already  paid  to  the  Contractor    and  the  Contractor  must  re-pay  those amounts
-  The Contractor must hand over all Works Requirements and Contractor's Documents to the Employer

Once  the  Works  have  been  completed  the  ER  certifies  the  "termination amount" which includes:

-  The additional cost of completing the Works
-  The loss and damage suffered by the Employer
-  The amounts due to the Employer by the Contractor

The  certificate  showing  the  termination  value  must  in  the  case  where  the Employer  does  not  start  completion  of  the  Works  within  6  months  after termination, issue as soon as practicable after the end of the 6 month period.

If  (as  would  be  normal)  the  termination  amount  is  more  than  the  termination value the Contractor must pay the Employer the difference within 10 working days of receiving the Employer's demand.   If the termination amount is less than the termination value then the Employer pays the Contractor the difference on receipt of an invoice.

As  with  all  termination  situations  one  of  the  crucial  things  that  the  Employer would have to address immediately is securing the Site and this he should do, by if necessary employing a security firm to see that the Contractor leaves the site as he is required to do pursuant to sub-clause 12.2.1 in an orderly manner.

No further payments should be made by the Employer to the Contractor until the certificate certifying the termination amount is issued by the ER.

In securing the Site the Employer should note that the Contractor is not entitled to remove Works Items or Contractor's Things from the Site unless required to do so by the Employer.   However, the Employer will need to make a practical assessment  on  this  and  the  most  important  thing  will  be  to  ensure  that  all Works Items necessary for completion of the Works are kept on Site.

It will obviously be necessary to complete the Works and the Employer should liaise  with the ER so as to assess what Specialist contracts or supply contracts should be assigned to the Employer.

The Employer will also be engaging another contractor to complete the Works and  will  also  be  making  a  call  on  the  Performance  Bond  provided  by  the Contractor.

<!-- image -->

In  making  an  assignment  of  any  sub-contractor's  or  supplier's  contracts  the Employer  may  have  to  arrange  with  them  for  payment  by  the  Employer  of amounts that the Employer has already paid to the Contractor.   This will be the subject of a claim by the Employer against the Contractor.

After Substantial Completion the Employer will receive from the ER a certificate indicating what if any amount is due by the Employer to the Contractor or by the  Contractor  to  the  Employer.      If,  as  is  likely,  an  amount  is  due  by  the Contractor to the Employer then the Employer should draft up and furnish  a demand for payment from the Contractor.   Should there be an amount due to the Contractor this will be payable by the Employer within 15 working days after receiving an  invoice  from  the  Contractor  furnished  on  foot  of  the  ER's certification.

## Non Payment by the Employer

Reference sub-clause 12.3

Failure by the Employer to pay any amounts due to the Contractor entitles the Contractor to suspend the Works if no payment is made within 15 working days after receipt by the Employer of a demand from the Contractor.

## Termination at Employer's Election

Reference sub-clause 12.5

The  Employer  is  entitled  by  the  Contract  to  terminate  the  Contractor's obligation  to  complete  the  Works  at  its  election  upon  giving  20  working  days notice to the contractor.

One important limitation on this power is that the Employer may not terminate under it for the purpose of obtaining another Contractor to execute/complete the works.

When the Employer terminates at his own election the consequences are set out in sub-clause 12.6 of the Contract and include:

-  The Contractor leaves the Site removing any Contractor's Things
-  The  Contractor  must  give  the  Employer  all  Works  Requirements  and  all Contractor's Documents
-  The Contractor provides the ER with a statement showing:
- -The unpaid value of the Works completed
- -The Contractor's demobilisation costs
- -Any  other  amounts  that  the  Contractor  is  entitled  to  under  the Contract excluding any damages

The sum of the above is known as the "termination sum".

The  ER  must  issue  a  certificate  to  the  Contractor  within  10  working  days  of receiving the statement of the termination sum.   The certificate is to show the amount due from the Employer to the Contractor or vice versa.

<!-- image -->

## The Contractor's  Obligations  under  the  Contract  (excluding  the  obligation  to complete) survive termination.

## Example:

The Employer might become aware during the course of the project that the Works will no longer be needed because of another larger project that is ongoing and that will effectively take away the necessity for the Works (for instance a relief road that will not be needed because another larger road scheme will cater for the traffic in question).

In such a case the Employer might wish to terminate the Contractor's obligation to complete the  Works  even  though  the  Contractor  is  not  in  default.    Where  this  arises  the  Employer should serve notice on the Contractor terminating the Contractor's obligation to complete and stating that he is utilising the provisions of sub-clause 12.5 of the Contract.   The notice should provide that it will take effect 20 working days after it has been delivered to the Contractor. As with all such notices the Employer should make absolutely sure that the notice is delivered properly to the correct address for service of such notices in accordance with sub-clause 4.14. The  Employer  should  also  obtain  the  original  of  the  Performance  Bond  provided  by  the Contractor and return this to the Contractor at the expiration of the 20 days notice.

Once again the Employer should ensure that the Site is adequately secured, that the Contractor leaves the Site in an orderly manner and removes all of the Contractor's Things.   The Employer should  ensure  that  the  ER  obtains  from  the  Contractor  all  Works  Requirements  and Contractor's  Documents.      Once  the  Contractor  has  provided  a  statement  of  the  amounts making  up  the  termination  sum  to  the  ER  the  ER  will  provide  (within  10  working  days  of receiving  the  statement)  a  certificate  to  both  the  Employer  and  the  Contractor  showing  the amount due from the Employer to the Contractor (or vice versa).   The Employer will then receive an invoice from the Contractor (or if the amount is due from the Contractor to the Employer the Employer should make a demand for payment of the sum) and the Employer is obliged to pay within 15 days of receipt of the invoice (the Contractor must pay any sum due by him within 10 days of the demand).

In a case of termination the Employer may need to consider whether the Contractor should be kept on as Project Supervisor or otherwise, the urgent appointment of a replacement Project Supervisor  for  the  Construction  Stage  in  relation  to  the  final  "mothballing"  of  the  Works. Alternatively if there is any part of the Works to be demolished then this would be a separate project requiring a new Project Supervisor.

## Payment as an Exhaustive Remedy

Reference sub-clause 12.6

The payment by the Employer to the Contractor of the sums provided for in clause 12  together with any other amounts due under the Contract before termination are stated to be the Employer's total liability to the Contractor. (sub-clause 12.6)

## Conciliation Relating to Termination

Reference sub-clauses 12.9 and 13.1

Where the Employer is of the view that an entitlement has arisen on his part to terminate the Contractor's obligation to complete the Works, the Employer has a  discretion  to  refer  the  issue  of  his  entitlement  to  conciliation.  (sub-clause 12.9.1)

<!-- image -->

The appointed conciliator must give his recommendation within 21 days after his appointment.

In the event that the Conciliator recommends that the Employer is entitled to terminate the Contractor's obligation to complete the Works for default and if the Employer does so within 60 days after the recommendation it may be found in subsequent arbitration proceedings that the Employer was not entitled to do so.  In such an event:

-  The  termination  nevertheless  stands  as  if  it  were  a  termination  at  the Employer's election
-  The  Contractor  is  compensated  as  if  the  termination  had  been  at  the Employer's  election  i.e.  the  Contractor  's  compensation  is  limited  to  the unpaid value of completed Works, his demobilisation costs and any other amounts to which he is entitled under the Contract
-  However, the Employer is entitled to engage another contractor to carry out or complete the Works

The Contractor has no other rights under the Contract or otherwise at law for the termination

## Example:

In  certain  circumstances  where  the  Employer  is  of  the  view  that  he  has  become  entitled  to terminate  the  Contractor's  obligation  to  complete  the  works  pursuant  to  sub-clause  12.1  he may, in view of the circumstances and the likelihood that the Contractor would challenge the termination,  wish  to  refer  the  question  of  his  entitlement  to  terminate  to  conciliation.      In arriving at such a decision the Employer would in conjunction with the ER look at the facts giving rise  to  the  potential  termination  and  consider  whether  they  are  absolutely  clear-cut.      In  the event  that  they  are  clear-cut  then  the  Employer  might  not  feel  it  was  incumbent  on  him  to conciliate on the matter but if there was any doubt it might be safer for him to do so.

If the  Employer  decides  to  conciliate  upon  the  matter  then  he  will  serve  notice  of  the conciliation on the Contractor pursuant to sub-clause 13.1 of the Contract.

If  the  Conciliator  recommends  that  the  Employer  is  entitled  to  terminate  then  the  Employer should do so within 60 days after the receipt of the Conciliator's recommendation.   The aim of this procedure is, that by following it, the Employer should hopefully safeguard his position and if the Contractor refers the entire matter to arbitration and it is ultimately held that the Employer was  not  entitled  to  terminate  then  the  provisions  of  sub-clause  12.9.3  will  apply  and  the termination will stand as if it was a termination at the Employer's election.

In  such  a  case  the  Employer  will  be  entitled  to  engage  another  Contractor  to  complete  the Works although obviously those works will be substantially delayed.

In  looking  at  the  circumstances  surrounding  a  decision  to  terminate,  the  Employer  would obviously look at any delays for which he (the Employer) is responsible.  In this regard attention would have to be paid to whether notice has been given by the Contractor in respect of any such delays within the time constraints set out in sub-clause 10.3 of the Contract.  Failure by the Contractor  to  comply  with  these  notice  provisions  could  (subject  to  the  ER's  discretionary power under sub-clause 10.5.2) could disentitle him in respect of his delay and/or compensation claim.    In  the  event  that  the  Contractor  is  entitled  then  it  would  be  appropriate  for  the Employer to address this situation prior to any conciliation concerning the Employer's right to terminate.

## 14.13 Dispute Resolution

## Conciliation

Reference sub-clause 13.1

The  Contract  provides  that  disputes  arising  in  connection  with,  out  of  the Contract  or  Works  are  to  be  referred  to  conciliation  and  ultimately  to arbitration if conciliation does not resolve the dispute.

Either party can request conciliation by a notice in writing specified to be a notice under sub-clause 13.1 of the Contract.

The parties must appoint the conciliator within 10 working days of the referral and in default the appointing body as set out in the Schedule (Part 1N) appoints.

The parties must make all information and documents available to the conciliator that he requires.

The conciliator may

-  meet the parties separately or together
-  consider documents provided by one party and not shown to the other
-  carry out investigations without the parties
-  use specialist knowledge
-  get legal or technical advice
-  set out the procedures to be followed

The conciliator's  appointment  may  be  set  out  in  the  Works  Requirements  or otherwise as agreed.

The  Conciliator  must  give  his  recommendation  if  the  dispute  is  not  resolved within 42 days after his appointment (sub-clause 13.1.8).

Each  party  has  45  days  in  which  to  give  notice  of  dissatisfaction  to  the  other party in writing (and specified to have been given under sub-clause 13.1).  Such a notice may issue in the event that no recommendation is given within 45 days of the appointment (sub-clause 13.1.9).

Once notice of dissatisfaction has been given, either party may serve notice of arbitration on the other (sub-clause 13.1.9).

If no notice of dissatisfaction is given within 45 days from receipt of the recommendation - the recommendation becomes binding on both parties and they can enforce it by reference to arbitration (sub-clause 13.1.10).

If a payment of money is recommended (even if notice of dissatisfaction is given) the money must be paid once a bond is furnished as security by the party

<!-- image -->

## receiving payment (the form of bond may be provided in the Works Requirements Model Form 17) (sub-clause 13.1.11) .

## The conciliation is confidential.

The conciliation process is  relatively  straightforward.      One  thing  that  is  new  in  the  forms  of Contract  is  the  provision  at  sub-clause  13.1.11  to  the  effect  that  if  a  payment  of  money  is recommended by the Conciliator the money is to be paid over upon the provision of a bond as security.  There is also provision for the repayment where applicable of money paid over on foot of  a  conciliator's  recommendation  or  interest  earned  on  such  moneys  where  an  arbitrator's award is for a lesser amount than the sum originally paid over. (sub-clause 13.1.1).

## Example:

If the Employer has discharged the monies due on foot of the conciliator's recommendation and has received a bond from the Contractor

Firstly, when considering the form of bond to be furnished by the Contractor in exchange for payment on foot of the recommendation it may be appropriate to consider carefully the proposed expiry date of the bond.  This is because the Employer may be confronted with an arbitration which may drag on for a considerable period and a bond which will be due to expire within a set period of time.

If  payment has been made and a bond pursuant to Model Form 19 has been provided the Employer should consider carefully his approach to the arbitration.   It may be that because the Contractor has received payment he does not want to pursue the arbitration or does not wish to be the Claimant in the arbitration.   However, it would be essential that the Contractor is the Claimant in the arbitration (unless circumstances dictate that he should not be) as otherwise it would become evident to the Arbitrator that payment has been made on  a  Conciliator's  recommendation.    It  would  therefore  be  essential  that  this  be  agreed (preferably  before  payment  over  of  the  recommended  amount)  and  that  the  Contractor agrees to prosecute the arbitration promptly and efficiently.

## Arbitration

## Reference sub-clause 13.2

The  final  dispute  resolution  mechanism  available  to  the  parties  is  that  of arbitration.

The relevant arbitration rules are as set out in the Works Requirements.

The  appointing  body  in  respect  of  the  arbitrator's  appointment  in  default  of agreement by the parties is that set out in the Schedule (Part 1N).

Disputes under the Contract are subject to the jurisdiction of the Irish courts and to the Public Works Arbitration Rules 2007.

The Contractor is obliged to appoint an agent for service of proceedings in the Schedule (part 2).

## 14.14 Comparison of Traditional and Design &amp; Build Forms for Building

| 7.9          | Access                          | The minor works contract does not contain the traffic obligations, set out in the traditional contracts, relating to the transport of large loads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 7.11         | Working Times                   | There is no clause in the minor works contract relating to the site working times of the Contractor's personnel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 8.5          | Rejection of Defects            | The minor works contract does not contain a mechanism allowing the ER to reject the works if a defect deprives the Employer of substantially the whole benefit of the works.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 9.4          | Programme Contingency           | The programme contingency regime in the minor works contract differs from the traditional contracts. In the minor works contract there is only one threshold in relation to the number of site working days' delay. If the total number of site working days' delay is less that the number of site working days stated in the Schedule there shall be no extension to the date for substantial completion. If the total number of site working days' delay exceeds the threshold stated in the Schedule only the days in excess of the threshold may be added to the Date of Substantial Completion. As in the traditional contracts, this clause does not apply to extensions of time resulting from delay events which are not compensation events |
| 9.7          | Taking Over Part of the Works   | The minor works contract does not contain a provision relating to the taking over of part of the works before substantial completion by the Employer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 10.7.3       | Delay Costs                     | The traditional contracts contain a clause relating to the scenario where, as a result of a compensation event the date for substantial completion has been extended, so that there is a period of 7 or more consecutive non-working days in the time between the starting date and the date for substantial completion, which would not have occurred were it not for the occurrence of the compensation event. In such instances the calculation of the adjustment to the contract sum should account for the period of non-working days. There is no equivalent clause in the minor works contract.                                                                                                                                                |

## CASE STUDY 1A - Completing the Schedule Part 1

## Building Works

Introduction

The contract is for the construction of a new civic office building for a local authority Employer (LA County Council) on the site of its old fire station just  outside  of  the town centre.  The LA CC has appointed consultants to design the building and the form  of  contract  to  be  used  is  the  Public  Works  Contract  for  Building  Works Designed by the Employer.

The various parties and consultants are:

The Employer:

LA County Council The Courthouse LA Town County LA

The Architect:

Santiago Balaclava &amp; Associados SA Paseo D Felipe VI 08028 Barcelona España

The Structural Engineer:

Telford, Brunel &amp; Eiffel 35 The Heights LA Town County LA

The Mechanical &amp; Electrical Consultant:

Stephenson, Edison &amp; Babbage 46 The Heights LA Town County LA

The Quantity Surveyor:

Willis Sealy Partnership 50 The Heights LA Town County LA

The Architect was appointed to the project following an architectural competition.

The 11,000sq m building is intended to be a flagship piece of architecture for the county and to contribute to urban regeneration within the county town.  It is to be a steel framed structure with reinforced concrete basement for car parking to maximise site utilisation.

The  cost  plan  indicates  an  estimated  construction  cost  of  €40,000,000,  including furniture and fittings and VAT but excluding professional fees.  The existing stores [which has a fibrous cement roof] was build in the 1950s and is to be demolished as part of the construction contract and monies are allowed in the cost plan for this.

The budget for the project is consistent with this cost plan and is extremely tight and the  County Manager has stipulated that cost certainty is of the utmost importance and the project must be delivered within the cost plan.

LA CC is currently  residing  at  a  number  of  addresses  and  its  annual  rental  bill  is €500,000  per  annum.    The  existing  Council  Chamber  and  offices  for  elected representatives  is  located  in  a  building  which  is  rented  at  a  rent  of  €30,000  per annum (this is included in the total rental figure mentioned above).

Specifications and drawings have been drawn up for the Project by the Architect and the  Design  Team.    A  Bill  of  Quantities  has  been  prepared  by  the  consultant Chartered Quantity Surveyor.

The  programme  for  the  Project  indicates  that  construction  will  commence  on  29 November  2007  and  be  completed  by  30  October  2009.    It  is  intended  that  the Council Chamber and accommodation for the elected representatives be completed by  31  August  2009  as  the  existing  premises  have  to  be  vacated  by  this  date, otherwise damages of €5,000 per week are payable to the landlord.

It  is  envisaged  that  a  number  of  Specialists  be  engaged  by  the  Contractor  on  the Works and these include:

- 1. Archaeologist;
- 2. Asbestos removal;
- 3. Piling;
- 4. Curtain walling and glazing;
- 5. Lifts;
- 6. Mechanical and electrical installations;
- 7. Artwork;
- 8. Workstations and furniture.

A fairly detailed archaeological report on the proposed site has been prepared and indicates  some  possible  buried  archaeological  remains  may  exist  from  mid  1700s which are not considered to be significant, however the planning conditions stipulate that they should be fully recorded prior to their destruction or removal.

The  site investigation carried out to date indicates nothing  worrying  from  a construction viewpoint.  Surveys indicate that there are no utilities on the site.

The LA CC in the last substantial construction project carried out for it encountered lengthy delays, including some three months due to exceptionally inclement weather conditions.    The  conditions  involved  very  heavy  rainfall,  coupled  with  high  winds which prevented progress.

## CASE STUDY 1B - Completing the Schedule Part 1

## Civil Engineering Works

## Case Study on a Design-Build Project in the Roads Sector

This  Project  concerns  the  construction  by  a  Design-Build,  or  Contractor-Design, Contract of a single carriageway road of 17km in extent, with a number of junctions and one bridge at  a  river  crossing.    The  estimated  cost  of  the  Project  is  €38.5m. Specimen Designs for the Bridge and for the Carriageway have been prepared as part  of  preliminary  work  and  these  are  made  available  to  tenderers  on  a  noncontractual basis as an appendix to the Works Requirements.

It is necessary to complete Schedule 1 for the Project.

Section A includes the expected contact and correspondence details for the parties and is similar to other forms.

The Employer has separately conducted a procurement competition for appointment of Materials Quality Assurance services. Irish Pavement Materials Quality Assurance Ltd are the successful service providers, a contract has been drawn up and the Employer intends to novate that contract to the successful DB Contractor. This  information  is  also  entered  in  Section A and  the  contract  is  appended  to  the Works Requirements in Section B .

The limit on authority of the ER to order any one variation has been set at €50,000 and the limit on the number of instructions changing the works requirement is set at 100.  The Employer's approval is required to exceed either limit.

There has been no Bill of Quantities produced, but the Employer requires in Section A  that  any  Bill  submitted  by  tenderers  in  support  of  their  tender  price  should  be measured  in  accordance  with  the  Method  of  Measurement  for  Roadworks  of  the NRA.

In Section  C , the  Employer  opts  not  to  seek  any  copyright  in  the  contract documents.

In Section D ,  insurance limits have been selected at €13,000,000 for both EL and PL insurance.  PI insurance is selected at a level of €6,200,000 any one event and an  excess  of  €25,000  is  deemed  tolerable  by  the  Employer  in  each  case.    PI insurance  will  be  kept  in  place  for  six  (6)  years  from  the  date  of  Substantial Completion and it needs to be in place from the earliest date that design work takes place  on  the  Project.    These  limits  should  be  set  with  advice  from  Insurance Specialists.

The Employer in this case has opted to have the Contractor extend insurance for the Section which is to be completed early, until the Substantial Completion of the whole of the Works.

In Section E , a performance bond is selected at 15% of the Contract Sum, reducing to 10% at the Date of Substantial Completion and this bond will be in place until a date 12 months after the date of Substantial Completion.

Collateral Warranties are to be sought from a number of Specialists in Section F , including the Culvert Design, the Bridge Design and the Landscaping Design, with the dates for the warranties and the withheld amounts in the event of late delivery set out.

<!-- image -->

In Section  G , the  Employer  has  required  that  the  section  of  carriageway  from Ch .0m to Ch. 6330m, including the junctions at both ends, must be available to take traffic  at  an  earlier  Substantial  Completion  date  for  that  section  and  liquidated damages have separately been calculated for this element and for the whole of the Works as shown.

In Section H , the Employer has opted not to take on himself an obligation to issue a Certificate of Substantial Completion if either the Works, or the nominated Section, are completed before the scheduled dates.

The  Defects  Period  is  nominated  at  12  months  from  the  Date  of  Substantial Completion in Section I .

The Section J Delay and Compensation events listing is different for the Contractordesigned form of contract, as one might expect.  The Employer has opted to pay delay costs associated with archaeological finds, in the light of preparatory investigative work, however he requires the Contractor to carry the risk associated with Utilities relocation delay.

The  First  Threshold,  for  the  purposes  of  sub-clause  9.4,  has  been  set  at  40  Site Working Days and the Second Threshold has also been selected as 40 Site Working Days.  The Employer has opted to pay the tendered amount in the Schedule Section 2E as the preferred way of handling costs of delay due to Compensation Events.

As  regards  the  weather  event  data  entries  in  Schedule  J,  the  Guidance  Notes discuss a 10 Year Return Period as the appropriate level of risk to transfer to the Contractor in this respect.  This has a precise hydrological meaning, as the event which, in a long record, is likely to be exceeded once in 10 years.  It is not equivalent to the worst event which occurred within the past decade, for example.  In a project lasting perhaps 24-36 months at construction stage, there is a significant probability of the 10 year event occurring, be that rainfall or wind or temperature.  Furthermore, it  is  not  impossible  (although  the  probability  is  low)  that  a  10  Year  Return  Period event  could  occur  twice  within  a  construction  period.    The  Contractor  carries  that risk.

Note  that  the  Schedule  requires  data  for  calendar  months  to  be  inserted.    The Contractor  also  carries  the  risk  associated  with  exceptional  weather  events  (of  10 Year Return Period or greater) which straddle two calendar months, without actually producing 10 Year Return Period totals in either calendar month.

Met Éireann should be consulted on the statistics to be entered in the Schedule by the  Employer,  drawn  from  the  Climatological  Station  most  representative  of  the conditions at the site of the Works.

As regards sub-clause 10.6.3, the rates to be used to assess the cost of plant are those  used  in  the  UK  Civil  Engineering  Contractors  Association  " Schedule  of Dayworks  carried  out  incidental  to  Contract  Works "  where  the  Sterling  rates  are deemed to be converted to euro by multiplying by a factor of 1.27.

In Section K , interim payments are intended to be monthly on a project of this size and  the  minimum  amount  for  an  interim  payment  has  been  set  at  €150,000. Retention has been set at 10%.

The President of Engineers Ireland has been nominated in Schedule Section L as the person who will appoint a Conciliator, should one be required.

<!-- image -->

## CASE STUDY 3 - Some Contract Administration Issues

## Delay and Compensation Events

This  case  study  refers  to  the  project  covered  by  Case  Studies  1  and  2,  the  LA County Council Civic Offices.

Three letters have been sent from the Contractor to the Employer's Representative as follows:

Letter Nr 1

Letter Nr 1 dated 15 January 2008

Items of archaeological interest

Letter Nr 2

Letter Nr 2 dated 30 January 2008

Unforeseen ground conditions

Letter Nr 3

Letter Nr 3 dated 30 September 2008

Proposed Instruction

Accompanying  each  letter  is  a  set  of  facts  as  determined  by  the  Employer's Representative.

## Delegates are requested to draft a response to each letter.

## Supplementaries

In the case of Letter Nr 1

What would the position have been if the Archaeologist had been directly engaged by the Employer?

## LETTER NR 1

## ITEMS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTEREST

Santiago Balaclava &amp; Associados SA 50 The Heights LA Town County LA

Dear Sirs

## Building Contract for LA County Council Civic Offices Building Notice Pursuant to Clause 10.3 of the Contract

I refer  to  the  above  Project  and  now  provide  substantiation  in  respect  of  the  delay  and compensation event notified to you in our letter dated 6 December 2007.

## 1.0 The Facts

The  Works  Requirements  indicate  that  the  novated  Specialist  archaeological  subcontractor  would  carry  out  its  archaeological  excavations  during  the  period  mid November to mid December 2007 and we had programmed for this period and for the attendance required.  The archaeological activities will now not be completed until mid January 2008, a whole month of delay because:

- 1. progress is significantly slower than had been anticipated due to the level of detailed recording required no doubt reflecting the archaeological interest of the buried ruins;
- 2. the  week  long  exceptionally  poor  weather  with  very  heavy  snow  during  the period 28 November to 4 December 2007 which meant that the archaeologists could not get on to site, with the blanket of snow the ground could  not  be  seen,  the  site  was  unsafe  and  moreover  the  ground  was  too hard to excavate because of ground frost and subsequently the effect of the melting snow was that the excavations had to be pumped out to enable the archaeologists work and the photographic record be generated. None of this was anticipated.

## 2.0 The Effects

This  delay  has  caused  a  one  month  or  21  site  working  days  to  the  Date  for Substantial Completion date as follows:

Delay Event (Weather Event)

5 working days delay

Compensation Event (Items of Archaeological Interest)

21 working days delay (to be drawn down from programme contingency)

## The facts as determined by the Employer's Representative

- 1. The Archaeology Specialist had previously indicated he would have four archaeologists working on the Project in the event he only had two;
- 2. The Contractor was genuinely delayed by the Archaeology Specialist;
- 3. There was snow (50mm deep) and air temperatures below 0° Celsius during the period 28 November to 4 December 2007 and during this period the Archaeology Specialist could not carry out any work;
- 4. The Employer's Representative has determined that the bad weather is not a weather event;
- 5. After  the  snow  melted,  the  Contractor  had  to  pump  out  the  excavations  and  provide some  additional  earthwork  support  to  enable  the  Archaeology  Specialist  continue working safely and make up for the lost time.

## LETTER NR 2

## UNFORESEEN GROUND CONDITIONS

Santiago Balaclava &amp; Associados SA 50 The Heights LA Town County LA

Dear Sirs

Building Contract for LA County Council Civic Offices Building Notice Pursuant to Clause 10.3 of the Contract

I refer  to  the  above  Project  and  now  provide  substantiation  in  respect  of  the  delay  and compensation event notified to you in our letter dated 17 January 2008.

## 1.0 The Facts

All  of  the  borehole  logs  in  the  site  investigation  reports  indicate  that  rock  is  to  be encountered some 4-6m below existing ground level and below the formation level of the  proposed  basement  car  park.  In  the  event,  significant  outcrops  of  hard  granite rock  have  been  encountered  at  1.5m  below  the  existing  ground  level  and  the estimated quantity of rock to be removed is some 2,000cu m.  This quantity has been measured  and  agreed  between  Employer's  Quantity  Surveyor  and  our  Quantity Surveyor.    These  outcrops  are  scattered  throughout  the  site  and  it  is  unrealistic  to consider advancing parts of the works until these have been excavated.

## 2.0 The Effects

This delay has caused a 51 working day delay to progress on site and the entitlement for our extension of time is calculated as follows:

Delay caused by rock

51 working days

Less

Delay to first threshold

21 working days

Delay to second threshold

20 working days

--------

Extension of time required

## The facts as determined by the Employer's Representative

- 1. The Contractor has indeed encountered hard granite rock on the site and the quantity is in the region of 2,000cu m;
- 2. There was no indication of this rock in any of the site investigation reports and the site investigation reports are found to be factually correct for the boreholes and trial pits that were sunk;
- 3. The Contractor's estimate of the delay period of 51 working days has been examined by the ER and is considered reasonable;
- 4. The Contractor is doing everything possible to mitigate the effects of the delay.

## 3.0 The Effects

We estimate that delay will delay progress by some 150 days and as this is caused by a  compensation event and the programme contingency has been fully used up we request that the Date for Substantial Completion be further extended to reflect this. We also wish to put on record the point that we have raised at our recent meetings that 150 days can only be our estimate of the delay at this stage - we will revert when the exact delay is known.

If you require further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours faithfully

Peter Rock Contracts Manager BUILD IT LTD

## The facts as determined by the Employer's Representative

- 1. The Employer has requested this additional change;
- 2. The Quantity Surveyor has agreed the quantities associated with the change;
- 3. The measured work has been priced at the rates in the Pricing Document and this has been agreed to by the Quantity Surveyor;
- 4. The  programme  has  been  reviewed  and  the  150  days  is  considered  reasonable, however the original scope is still to be completed by the original date;
- 5. The  Employer's  Representative  considers  that  it  should  be  possible  to  complete  the original scope by the contract date for Substantial Completion;
- 6. The programme contingency has been used by earlier compensation events.

## 19  Frequently Asked Questions

<!-- image -->

## 19. Frequently Asked Questions

## QUESTIONS ON RISK

- 19.1 What of risks other than those listed in Schedule Part 1, Section K? If they are to be the Contractors', what is the mechanism of allocation in the Contract Documents?

Part K of the Schedule Part 1 allocates certain risks to the Contractor, either by the prescribed allocation, or by election of the Employer where this discretion is permitted. Any other risks are deemed to be the Contractors' risks, except those giving rise to a change in the Works Requirements. The identification and evaluation of risks would be part of the Risk Assessment and Management process in the development of the Works Requirements.

Risks which materialise and require change in the Works Requirements are at the Employers' risk, accordingly robustness of risk assessment and evaluation, and effective description and transfer in the Works Requirements are important in the protection of the fixed price lump sum tender.

- 19.2 Is it intended that there will be individual items for risk in a Bill of Quantities?

There should be separate items in the BoQ to allow for pricing of the risks listed in Section K of Schedule Part 1 which are allocated to the Contractor as the Method of Measurement may require.

Those other risks (other than those in Section K) are allocated by the appropriate clauses of the Works Requirements, and the cost of providing for them is included generally in the rates in the BoQ.

- 19.3 Does a project budget get revised as decisions are made on risk transfer?

Risks that are not transferred to the Contractor, are retained by the Employer. Accordingly decisions which transfer an appropriate risk into the contract scope, essentially move that provision into the contract, across from the Employers' budget for non contract items. These transfers represent movements of value within an overall budget for contract- and non-contract items, which budget should not change when the overall scope of work and timeframe do not change. Where the risk transfer is well defined, well prepared and appropriate, this transfer is a good value for money decision, that reduces the cost of a project, compared to one where risks are not appropriately allocated. Guidance on this issue can be found in the Guidance Note on Budget Development in the Capital Works Management Framework.

<!-- image -->

- 19.4 Does the Contractor get paid the value of the risk item if the risk does not arise?

Where work is proceeded with, and a risk associated with that work has been transferred and priced, but the risk does not materialise, the Contractor is entitled to be paid the cost of his provision for that risk, on the basis that, had the risk occurred, that would have been his only entitlement for it, apart from any reliefs specified under Schedule 1 Section K. Where an element of work is not being proceeded with, then the contract sum would be reduced accordingly, and risk associated with that element, and priced in the rates for it would be credited out automatically in that calculated reduction.

- 19.5 Are methodologies put forward for the assessment of approach to the allocation of risk?

The Training Manual includes a section on Risk Management. Risks are first identified and evaluated, and the best way of treating risks is identified before they are allocated to the party best able to manage them. Risks may need to be further evaluated, by means of investigatory work, before they can be allocated.

Methodologies include the use of risk workshops, where, under the chairmanship of an experienced facilitator, risks are identified and their expected likelihood and impact are defined under the broad headings of Safety, Planning, Finance, Design, Construction, and Operation. Once the risks are identified, the method of treating these risks must then be aligned with the drafting of the Works Requirements, and with the selections made, in Schedule Part 1 particularly.

## QUESTIONS ON PROCUREMENT &amp; TENDER ASSESSMENT

- 19.6 Is there guidance on the relative merits of using the Open or Restricted procedures?

The relative merits of these procedures are discussed in the Guidance Note on the Works Contracts. The Open Procedure has advantages, particularly programming, but it has the risk that a bidder may prepare a tender and not pass the prequalification phase.  As with all procedures, it is necessary  to ensure that you do not mix selection and award criteria.

- 19.7 If the Tender Sum exceeds the Budget, is a Bill of Reductions exclusively a post contract issue?

Yes, but you must be aware of making a "material change" in cutting back the scope of work on which the contract is procured, potentially to the disadvantage of the other tenderers.   Also, unless the procurement process is definitively complete, this process could involve an element of post tender negotiation, which is prohibited.

<!-- image -->

- 19.8 The values selected for the contingent items in the MEAT example may well result in loading of the bid rates in the Tender, especially where, because of the choice of notional items below the Tender Sum, there is little impact on the MEAT Comparative Cost?

These values are selected by the client and should be the expected value of the item in question, having regard to professional judgement of the client or his consultant and previous experience on similar projects.  The expected value is not so low as to encourage loading of rates and is not so high as to pack the MEAT with contingent items.

- 19.9 If you start on an assumed Budget of less than €5m, working on the Minor Works Form of Contract, and you drift over the limit as tenders are received, do you have to change the form of contract to be used?

Good budgeting should not leave you in this position, but you would have to stay with the procurement choice originally made and run with the tendered contract.

- 19.10 If you take tenders on one Form and found you had to use another, could this be negotiated?

No form of negotiation on fundamental matters, particularly price, may take place in the open or restricted procedure.

- 19.11 If the estimate is just under €5m can you opt to use the Main Form?

Yes, this option is available where it is appropriate to do so. One should probably opt for the main contract form in the case stated.

- 19.12 If the second option is chosen on delay, i.e. where no rate has been tendered, no delay element in the MEAT calculation ensues?

Where daily rates are not tendered, the Employer pays only for the cost of delay actually incurred. This is not therefore an issue for assessment in the MEAT calculation.

- 19.13
- Will the Employer have to create a rule for rebalancing items in the BOQ to ensure arithmetic errors are corrected to maintain the lump sum bottom line as fixed?  Are the potential number of variables not very large, when the bottom line is being held? Should there not be a commonality of approach because precedent will apply across the board anywhere these contracts are used?

The approach on correction of tenders is set out in the Guidance Note in Section 2.7.3. The example given in the GN related to correction of errors in

<!-- image -->

calculating VAT is also relevant. The fixed price lump sum tender total remains unchanged in any correction of arithmetic error in the BoQ.

- 19.14 Can the Contracting Authority reject an abnormally low tender?

Yes, nothing has changed with respect to this aspect of procurement procedure, and an abnormally low tender may be rejected, provided that due process under the EU Directives has been followed in arriving at the conclusion that the tender is abnormally low.

- 19.15 If the Tender wasn't signed, or the Tender Sum wasn't transferred, from the BoQ to the Tender Form correctly, is the tender disqualified?

It depends on the stated position on this point in the Instructions to Tenderers. In the absence of a clear rule requiring disqualification, the Contracting Authority has discretion.  Is it a proportionate response to reject a tender for such an oversight?  It should be drafted so that no hair-trigger rejection responses arise on matters which can easily be clarified without risk to transparency or equal treatment.

- 19.16 In a Contractor Designed contract, why introduce craftsmen rates or the like in the MEAT calculation, or in valuing change orders. There is no facility for monitoring these things in Design-Build?

Even where this is no BoQ, there is still a need to have a means to value Change Orders, and these rates are likely to be required for this purpose.

- 19.17 What of variants where the workload of assessment of the tenders or the criteria for award conflicts with the variant offered?  For example,  a high density development option in parallel with an Employer-preferred low density main design?

Tender appraisal workload isn't hugely different than is normal with variants at present and is accepted as covered in the services.  Variants rules need to be prescribed in the Instructions to Tenderers to prevent variants at odds with the Contracting Authority's fundamental or core objectives emerging. Additional costs arising from accommodating a variant, or consequential costs in building/civil engineering, need to be planned for through risk assessment, then addressed and locked into the fixed price.

- 19.18 Why not accept an offer of a "free" parent company guarantee in lieu of the Bond?

Such an approach is contrary to good practice as described in the Guidance Note. It should be remembered that problems with a contractor often have their roots in a problem with the Parent Company itself, so that the Parent Company Guarantee is not a robust guarantee in such circumstances. Refer to the Guidance Note at Section 2.3.2.

<!-- image -->

19.19 If there's an expiry date on a Bond, can you not have a position where you threaten calling in Bond in order to get a Bond extended?

It is safer to have a Bond whose expiry date is predicated upon an event such as Substantial Completion (say, 15 months after its issue) in which case the situation outlined is unlikely to arise. The difficulty in threatening to call in a bond such as the Performance Bond to be provided by the Contractor under the contract is that a call is only permitted where the Contractor is in breach or has its obligation to complete terminated.

## QUESTIONS ON CONTRACT FORMALITIES, PROFESSIONAL INDEMNITY INSURANCE AND FITNESS-FOR-PURPOSE STANDARD

- 19.20 On signing of contract documents, are there protocols on signing every page, or on signing a particular number of copies?

There are no protocols and there is no need to sign every page.  However, if there are a large number of documents involved, it may be appropriate to have the parties sign or initial each bound document for identification purposes. The potential necessity for initialling or signing individual pages only becomes relevant if there are loose pages that ought to be identified separately.

- 19.21 What if the Contractor is tardy or reluctant to seal the contract?

The Contractor is required to execute its tender under seal and the acceptance of the tender will create a contract under seal.

The Bid Bond is a mechanism which can be used if there is a concern that a tenderer might not honour its tender or where a particular contract is absolutely essential to a larger project and any withdrawal by the successful tenderer would cause substantial losses etc.  [see Guidance Note at Section 2.3.1.].

- What if there is a design problem with the Works after six years and before twelve years and the Contract has been executed under seal?

Where a contract has been executed under seal the time within which the Employer may sue for any breach is independent of the date of the contract execution but is referable to the date of the breach of contract itself.  Thus in the case outlined, the Employer could sue the relevant party for breach of contract, within twelve years from the date of the breach itself.  This is likely to be the date that the actual defective design work was carried out although the final date can sometimes be different, for instance, the date by which the defective design could have been rectified by the guilty party.

Consultants will need ongoing annual renewal of PI but that's really as far as practicalities permit.  There's little point in pursuing a consultant for failing to

- 19.22

<!-- image -->

maintain annual cover out in year ten.  If it's not there, its not there, and the fact of that is that he may not be worth pursuing in the absence of PI cover.

One should also keep sight of the fact that we are only speaking here of actions for breach of contract.  An Employer who has suffered loss as a result of defective design could also proceed under the tort of negligence and would have six years from when the damage actually occurred (not when it was discovered) within which to sue.

- 19.23 If the Contracting Authority issues a Letter of Acceptance, is there not an attraction for the (now) Contractor to decline to execute a contract under seal?

This can be avoided by requiring that the Tenderer seal the Form of Tender. If he doesn't seal it, it can be sent it back for sealing, and if the tenderer refuses, this might be considered grounds to reject the bid. The Model Form requires the tender to be sealed.

- 19.24 Is it appropriate for a "Letter of Intent" to a Consortium to require that they put in place the Joint Venture legal entity so that you can send a "Letter of Acceptance" to the "Contractor" as it seems to be worded?

It may be that the Contractor will be an unincorporated group, i.e. it may not form any separate legal entity.  The Contractor will then be all of the members having joint and several responsibility.  Thus, each of the members of the consortium will be individually responsible for the carrying out of the entire of the Works.

- 19.25 How important is it that the €1 exchanges hands in the collateral warranty?

It is executed under seal in any case and so it is not necessary.  Even it were not executed under seal it would not be vital.

- 19.26 Is the Performance Bond required on date of issue of Letter of Acceptance?

Evidence for the imminent availability of the Bond is perhaps as best you can get. An updated letter from the Bonding company, to the effect that they are endorsing a prior letter provided at the time of tender, and stating that there is no impediment to issue of the Bond, might fulfil this requirement. Clause 9.1.2 lists what is needed and the Start Date runs from Letter of Acceptance.

- 19.27 Occupancy Vs Possession of the Site; what are the implications, generally or on insurances?

Contractor should experience no great difference.  Contracts have been referred to Insurance sector for consultation and this was not an issue of

<!-- image -->

importance.  The fundamental issue is that the Contractor is not entitled to exclusive occupancy of the Site. There is an entitlement of Employer to have his own contractors on site if he wishes to do.

- 19.28 Can assignment take place by Employer onto other parties?

There is no specific provision for Employer to assign.  However, as a matter of law, he would be entitled to assign the benefit of the contract without the consent of the Contractor.

- 19.29 Form of Retention Bond - is it included in the Tender Documents? Will its cost not exceed the interest value of the Retention Money? Almost by definition, if he needs this money badly, will the cost of the Retention Bond not be very high?

It is a matter for the Contractor to consider the value to him of release of the Retention money, in exchange for provision of a Retention Bond.

- 19.30 Form of Tender says he (can't/won't) withdraw.  What if he makes a mistake and there is a Bid Bond in place?

In the quasi-contract that exists as a matter of agreeing to consider a tender, you could relax that position, but it would have to be an agreed relaxation.  A Bid Bond is rare and might be used where there is "history" of withdrawal and you see an offender coming through in Pre-Qualification but it is not intended to penalise anyone on a Bid Bond issue.  Is the error so serious he risks going under in the Contract?  If so, you might prefer to release him.

- 19.31 Can you ask one tenderer to provide a Bid Bond and not others?

No

- 19.32 If PI Insurance is needed from a Contractor, under the Restricted Procedure, do you not have to prequalify tenderers on ability to get "fit for purpose PI insurance"?

Insurance industry have looked at all the provisions of the contract, and it presumably recognises the issue of the fitness for purpose obligation.  When one looks at the actual requirement in the contract in this regard it merely requires that the Contractor has PI cover per the limits in the Contract but does not say he must insure against a fitness for purpose obligation.

Presumably if this is not insurable in the general market it will simply be something that the Contractor does not have cover for and accordingly, something for which he bears any additional risk.

- 19.33 Can Contractor in a DB Contract require a collateral agreement from his Consultant in favour of the Client, so the latter has access to PI cover of the Consultant?

<!-- image -->

Although the Consultant agrees by the Conditions of Engagement that he is willing to be novated to the Contractor, neither those conditions nor the Novation Agreement itself requires him to actually enter into the collateral agreement.  Thus, in a situation where such a novation is anticipated, it would be necessary for the Employer to provide a copy of the warranty to the Consultant with a requirement that it be executed at the time of novation.  In addition, the requirement that the Contractor provides a warranty from the Consultant (as a Specialist) would be provided for in the Schedule to the construction contract at part 1F).

- 19.34 When is PI Insurance required from a Contractor in a traditional Contract?

It is not necessarily appropriate to automatically seek PI cover from a Contractor in traditional contracts.  However, one must recognise the fact that the Contractor may have some small design function.  Even if a Specialist has PI cover and a collateral warranty is in place, it may be felt appropriate to have the additional protection of PI cover for the Contractor, particularly as the Contractor has full responsibility in any event for all design by Specialists.   In theory at least, the Specialist might disappear, their PI cover might be discontinued and the Employer might be left with a worthless collateral warranty and nobody but the Contractor to pursue for a serious design defect.  In such circumstances the Employer might be glad of the Contractor's PI cover.

- 19.35 Are the PI Insurance cover requirements effectively double counting as between the Contractor and Specialists?

The requirement of PI cover from the Contractor is an optional one and need not be availed of unless it is deemed appropriate. There may be a degree of overlap with PI in a Contractor Designed contract, where there are Specialists, but it might be necessary if the Contractor becomes insolvent, to have recourse to the warranty of the Specialist with respect to design done by him, and not done by others. [And see also the comments above in relation to PI cover.]

- 19.36 The design obligation of the Contractor in a Design and Build Contract is one of "fitness for purpose", If one looks at the collateral agreement, to be provided by any of the Specialists the obligation worded there however is not necessarily "fitness for purpose" but may be "reasonable skill and care".

The Employer would have to be careful so as to ensure that in seeking collateral warranties from various Specialists, he has adequate protection and that if a Specialist is providing an element for inclusion into the Works which must be fit for its specific purpose so that the rest of the Works will function, then he should require an obligation of fitness for its purpose.  However, whichever obligation the Employer requires, the Contractor will, nevertheless have his obligation as referred to above.

<!-- image -->

## 19.37 Road Traffic Act insurance is a permitted exclusion under the contracts but is this appropriate?

The Contracts were carefully considered by distinguished insurance professionals and it was regarded as appropriate to exclude such matters, presumably because this insurance is in any event required by law and the Contractor is required to comply with all laws.

- 19.38 What does "fit for intended purpose" mean?

In the case of goods or a manufactured product it means fit for the purpose for which such goods or items are normally used.  In the case of a design it means that the overall building or plant will be suitable for its intended function (as made known in the Employer's Requirements).

- 19.39 If a structure serves two purposes, must it be fit for both purposes?

This will depend upon the purpose of the structure under the Contract.  It would be most unlikely for a structure that has two purposes not to be required to meet the requirement for both.

- 19.40 Do you need two sets of contract documentation?

There is only one contract but there can be as many originals as people require. It is usual to have one original set of Contract Documents for each party executing the Contract.

- 19.41 What are appropriate excess limits for PI Insurance?

Very low excess limits are hard to get in the insurance market but an excess of 80-100k looks pretty high; one around €50k seems more appropriate for larger companies, and even this is too high for smaller companies.  In many cases a limit of between €10,000 and €25,000 would be appropriate, and the excess level should be reasonable having regard to the range of firm sizes quoting for the project.

- 19.42 Does there need to be Model Forms included with each contract?

Reference to "Model Form 8" would be unambiguous, but it might be useful if there was a pro-forma insertion checklist.

- 19.43 Why no separate Model Form for appointment of PSDP?

There is a Model Form 10 covering the PSDP.

<!-- image -->

- 19.44 With respect to the Form of Tender, in the quasi-contract that exists where a tender will be examined once it is validly submitted, where is the Consideration for agreement to keep open the tender?

The consideration is generally regarded as the willingness of the contracting authority to consider the tender in question.

- 19.45 PI Insurance extends for 6 years.   What is the position if the Consultant is no longer in business?

The insurance will lapse (unless he has taken out run-off cover).   PI tends to be year-to-year and on a "claims made" basis

- 19.46 Assignment of Collateral Warranties?  If it's a PI level for required design specialists, does Employer have to increase the PI cover when assigned to a higher risk function (example:-sweetshop now becoming heavily loaded warehouse store).

You can only look for the appropriate level of PI from the outset, or else change by agreement.

## QUESTIONS ON STATUS OF THE BILL OF QUANTITIES

- 19.47

What is the function of a Bill of Quantities, when remeasurement of work no longer applies?

The Bill of Quantities still serves a number of purposes, even when remeasurement no longer applies. It serves cost-effective tendering, by drawing the works items and their descriptions, which comprise the Lump Sum, into a common document for all tenderers to price on a like-for-like basis. It further assists the tender evaluation process by providing information on the balance of pricing in the tender. It is used in contract management to assist in interim certification, to predict cash flow, to assist in valuation of Change Orders and to support calculation of price variation entitlements. Finally it is used to record and classify costs in accordance with the Capital Works Management Framework.

- 19.48 Can a Bill be both a Works Requirements document and a Pricing Document?

The Bill of Quantities can be a Works Requirements document, as well as a Pricing Document. In the former role, it is normal to strike out the quantities themselves, leaving the item descriptions to stand, to be interpreted collectively with the other Works Requirements Documents in the order of priority stated in the Contract.

<!-- image -->

- 19.49 If rates have no real meaning in relation to the lump sum, then is it not open to possible abuse by Tenderers sprinkling mischievous rates all over the place in a Pricing Document, all aimed at securing later advantage at Change Orders?

It is part of tender assessment to check that rates in the BoQ reflect the value of the work item, in so far as it is possible to do this.  Rebalancing of rates may be required to ensure that the scenario postulated in the question is avoided, maintaining the tender total fixed, in accordance with the Guidance Note.

## QUESTIONS ON SPECIALISTS

- 19.50 In Specialist procurement, how can the following scenario be handled?
- a. Top of range Specialists are put forward by Tenderer
- b. They are successfully prequalified
- c. The Tenderer pitches his tender at a level which inherently presumes someone cheaper will later be acceptable, and he persists with applications to agree substitution until the Specialist in his presumed price range gets accepted?

The same prequalification thresholds and criteria used in the original prequalification process will apply to any later substitution.

- 19.51 In the Prequalification stage for Specialist, if the only one in a particular Specialist category fails to prequalify, the whole bid fails. Is there a contradiction between this and permitting substitution of Specialists for a successful tenderer after the award stage?

There is no contradiction when the same prequalification criteria are used to admit any substitute, the standard for acceptance of a substitute Specialist is not less than that used to prequalify Specialists at tender stage.

- 19.52 Are Specialists separately bonded?

No, they are part of the main contract, covered with respect to responsibilities by the Contractor, as if they were his own personnel, and therefore covered by his bond.

- 19.53 Can ER ask that a Specialist be removed from the Site or its contract terminated?

The Specialist has the legal status of Contractors Personnel so you have the option in accordance with the terms of the Contract.  Thus at sub-clause 5.6, it is provided that the ER may request the removal of any Contractor's Personnel

<!-- image -->

from the Site for reasons of negligence, incompetence or that their presence is not conducive to safety, health or good order

- 19.54 Is a Designer a subcontractor?

A Designer may be a subcontractor although he need not be e.g. if he were working purely as a Consultant to the Employer. If he is doing design work for the Contractor then he is by definition, a Specialist.

- 19.55 Why would a Contractor propose Specialists, why not just use them as subcontractors?

If Employer nominates particular work categories as specialist areas, over which he wishes to exercise a minimum quality threshold type of control, he may designate these as Specialist areas, and the Tenderer has to make nominations.

- 19.56 If Contractor is responsible anyway, why have a Collateral Warranty with the Specialist?

If Specialist is considering terminating his contract with the Contractor, he has to give notice to Employer, who has "step in" rights under which he may require the Specialist to continue working directly for him under the Contract, under Clauses 5.4 and 12.1.  Also, if the Contractor becomes insolvent, the Employer can pursue the Specialist under his Collateral Warranty. This may provide him with rights of recovery additional to those he would have if no contractual link was in place and he was forced to proceed in the tort of negligence only. If the Contractor becomes insolvent, and the Employer wishes to retain the Specialist, he could novate that Specialist to a new Contractor employed to finish the works.

- 19.57 Does something done by a Specialist have to comply with Works Requirement to be fit for purpose?  If for example, there's a piece of work which fulfils its purpose, but supporting paperwork required in Works Requirements is not complete?

This would depend on the terms of the Contractor's sub-contract with the Specialist.  However the terms of this document are most unlikely to be less stringent than the Contractor's Contract with the Employer and the provisions of this Contract will of course, include the Works Requirements.

- 19.58 Does a Specialist have to be named in the Contract?

No, but if an entity is doing design, it is a Specialist. Normally a Specialist is named in the Works Requirements, or in the Works Proposals, and in the case of substitution, then the substitute Specialist becomes part of the Works Proposals.

<!-- image -->

- 19.59 What form of contract would be used with a Novated Specialist?

Effectively the same form as main form (or other back to back form), but with some differences between selections in Schedule Part 1. Whichever form of Contract is used by the Employer, it would go straight across to the Main Contract, unaltered.

Novation in this manner would be exceptional, rather than the norm. The Employer, in preparing his contract with the Specialist to be novated, would research the market to determine what minimum amendments to the standard form might have to be made to attract interest from the Specialist market. Having got unqualified tender responses, he then concludes his contract with the Specialist. The Main Contractor is instructed that he must accept this novation, in the Main Contract on the standard forms of contract without amendment. He must then take a view on whatever risk premium he needs to neutralise the effect to him of any special terms in the novated contract, so that he fully addresses this in his own price.

- 19.60 Is it possible to novate the Specialists as a mechanism to shoehorn Nominated Subcontractors into these Contracts?

Novation is a non preferred form of procuring Specialists.  The Employer does not need to use this mechanism to achieve the benefits of nomination without its problems.

## QUESTIONS ON COMPLETION OF THE SCHEDULES

19.61 "Date" for Substantial Completion.  Does it have to be a real date?

Not necessarily.  It could be either a fixed date or as is more likely, as a duration from the date of the Letter of Acceptance.

- 19.62 The risk described in Part K No 8 of Schedule Part 1 uses the term "Employers personnel". This could potentially mean Planning Officers for a Local Authority. If they "interfere" in defence of a
- planning permission or statutory duty, is this a compensation event?

There could conceivably be an argument that officers of a Local Authority not connected with the project in question did interfere with the Contractor. However, it is most unlikely that this would occur in such away as to give rise to a claim. The inclusion of a Planning Permission within the general scope of the term "Consent" creates an obligation on the Contractor to comply with this consent. Other legislation, that the Employer may have a duty to check compliance upon, is also included under "Law". If the Employer intervenes in his capacity as designated enforcement body in relation to a statutory obligation, he would be entitled to do so and there would be no entitlement to compensation arising from this.

<!-- image -->

19.63

The definition of unforeseeable includes the phrase " having inspected the site and surroundings " What if a landowner prevents access to the site at the time the tenderer wishes to examine it?

This is a risk which would emerge at the Clients' own workshop on risk, and the Client would have to consider the need to arrive at a point of closure on all his contract planning before going to tender. If the land has been acquired, the Client has legal rights to prevent such action by owners of adjacent lands etc. which he should enforce. If such inspection by tenderers is frustrated as described, then the Client should review his risk allocation selections during the tender period, and decide if, given all the information provided to tenderers, it remains value for money to allocate risk as he proposes to do .

- 19.64 With Subsoil Investigation contracts, the Contracting Authority often cannot guarantee the factual accuracy of the SI Report and, if it included in the Works Requirements, is there therefore relief under Schedule Part 1 Section K Risk 5 for "factual error in works requirements"?

Contracting Authorities should carefully review their management and supervision of subsoil investigation contracts to ensure that SI Contractors are held to their responsibilities under their contracts to ensure their reports are factually correct. If the SI Report is included in the Works Requirements, then factual error (and this must be outside the question of error of interpretation) will have implications under Risk 5.   Presumably, if such an issue did arise and caused loss to the Employer, he would have an entitlement to pursue the site investigation contractor pursuant to that contract.

- 19.65 Does the figure entered under the second threshold on the programme contingency in Schedule Part 1 have to be a cumulative figure with respect to the first threshold?

No, the second threshold is not cumulative, it stands as a selection in itself without regard to the numerical value selected for the first threshold.

<!-- image -->

## QUESTIONS ON ENABLING CONTRACTS AND INVESTIGATION CONTRACTS

19.66

If one has an archaeological report, and it has described findings in one area of the site, and it recommends, and the Employer provides, a supervising archaeologist for elsewhere, in what sense are later artefacts that may be found ever "foreseeable" or " unforeseeable"? If they are deemed "foreseeable" by the Employer, in defence of a claim, how can he resist the import of a question as to why, if they are now "foreseeable", did not the original archaeological investigation extend to unearthing them?

If an archaeological report such as the one described is made known to the Contractor when tendering it would be very difficult for him to argue that he could not have foreseen other such finds on the Site when the definition of "unforeseeable" is taken into account.  It is of course always possible that in such a case the Contractor might say that the report indicated clearly that no other finds existed, but such an argument would depend on the actual circumstances prevailing at the time and the wording of the report itself.

## GENERAL QUESTIONS

19.67

On the scope of coverage of these contracts in the Public Sector, Circular 33/06 indicates exemptions apply where the agency is not a government department, or body under its aegis, and where more than 50% of the funding comes from a source other than the exchequer. In relation to this funding rule, does it include instances where the Client makes assets available, such as land for an interchange or site?

If the land or similar asset has been provided as a quid pro quo, when it would otherwise have been paid for from the capital budget, the value should be taken into account in assessing whether the new forms of contract should apply.

19.68 Contractor puts forward an alternative model equivalent in safety and suitability, but its key dimensions are different and its tying-in characteristics with other services are different, how is consequential change cost following model selection to be dealt with?

In Employer Design, as part of risk assessment during detailed design, the potential constraints in building works or M&amp;E Services, of making particular selections of major plant items, need to be examined. Cost effective design provision, by way of adequate dimensioning of rooms, sizing of ducting for connecting services etc., in order to permit a range of plant item choices to remain open, and to accommodate the most advantageous plant item choice, is encouraged. This could be accommodated under a " Shell and Fit-out " basis,

<!-- image -->

where the main services are taken to a terminal point outside a civil/building works shell, and the shell is sized to accept the range of plant items likely to be offered, and a phased handover allows the item to be installed and commissioned on its own programme. This will allow the plant item to be incorporated, without expensive consequential effects influencing other areas of the contract, and without extra cost arising through Change Orders.

- 19.69 It is noted that Standard Methods of Measurement are amended by the Department of Finance in the appendices to align them with the fixed price lump sum concept. Are the NRA rules of measurement also to be amended in the same way?

There will be changes to align the NRA Method of Measurement to the principles in the new contracts.

- 19.70 Insurance thresholds look the same in both the Minor Works and the other Forms of Contract.  Is this intended by the insurance expertise advising on Conditions of Contract development?

Yes.

- 19.71 Do all of the Contract Document features apply to Minor Works?

Mostly yes, the Guidance Note has a comparison table at Appendix A. The most notable difference is the single threshold for the Programme Contingency in the Minor Works form.

- 19.72 Does the €5m limit on the Minor Works Contract include VAT?

Yes, it is VAT inclusive.

- 19.73 Is it necessary to have a Performance Bond for a small contract, for example Portacabins valued at say €600k, involving no more than three certificates over 4 months?

Yes. While the sum in a given contract may appear small, the problem of several contracts for the same Client with one contractor may aggregate the exposure to a much larger figure.

- 19.74 Do Liquidated Damages have to be related to a loss or if not, does there have to be a bonus?

Yes they are related to a loss, in that the LDs must be a pre-estimate of loss and the pre-estimate must be genuine, but there's no implied bonus.  Penalties (monetary deductions greater than and unrelated to any pre-estimated loss) are unenforceable and the presence of a bonus provision will not act as a saver.  If there was a bonus, it might give an indication to a court of the importance of programme to the client.

<!-- image -->

- 19.75 What does Risk 12 in Section K of Schedule Part 1 refer to, in the context of Clause 3.2?

If the Works suffer damage due to matters which are at the Contractor's risk under sub-clause 3.2 before Substantial Completion the Contractor is entitled to an extension of time for completion (subject to clauses 9 and 10) but the event is not a compensation event and he is not entitled to an adjustment of the Contract Sum.

- 19.76 How far out do access routes go?  If vehicle is taxed and licensed, is he not entitled to use all roads?

Yes he is.  However as between himself and the Employer, he is responsible for ensuring that he can gain access via all intended access routes.  He is also obliged to take reasonable steps to see that the Site traffic obeys the law and does not cause nuisance.

- 19.77 What is the difference between "part" and "Section"

Section has a definition in terms of the contract, but a part can be any part of the works.

- 19.78 Can contracts with seasonal constraints be procured out of season and novated into main contract?

You have to signal this intent in the Works Requirements.

## QUESTIONS ON CLAUSES OF THE CONTRACT

19.79 Contract refers to relevant statutory provisions in Clause 2.5.  With respect to possible law changes, is a "catch all" not required?

Refer to "Legal requirement" definition [Clause 2.2] and to the interpretation provision at sub-clause 1.2.2 (6) where it is stated that references to any Law includes any amendments and replacements.  It covers the matter of the question.

- 19.80 Clause 3.3.1  What is meant by "profit".  Why would reinstatement value for building include "profit"?

The Contractor may have to re-build the Works if for instance they are burned down due to no fault of his, simply because he has responsibility for the Works and for their ultimate completion.  It is regarded as reasonable that the Contractor in carrying out such re-building work should be entitled to his reasonable profit as otherwise he would effectively be carrying out what could be a complete reconstruction for nothing.

<!-- image -->

19.81 Is it necessary to have all the reporting requirements and programming requirements in Clause 4 on the Minor Works Form?

The reporting requirements as contained in the full contract forms are not contained in the Minor Works form, which has a far simpler provision in this regard.  In the full contract forms the provisions may be relaxed by the Works Requirements or by the ER. It is in any event not a bad thing to have clear evidence that the contract is being managed properly, regardless of its size.

- 19.82 With respect to Article 4 of the Agreement; Is there any significance to be read into the phrase "initial Contract Sum", and the use of "initial" as a possible qualifying adjective? Could the use of a different phrase earlier in the paragraph be construed as referring to two different sums?

The word "initial" is merely explanatory and is intended to indicate the Contract Sum before it becomes subject to any adjustment in accordance with contract.

- 19.83 Is there a potential in a Claim for a Contractor to invoke Clause 4.1 on co-operation?  Can a Contractor seek ER's records in support of his claim, perhaps arguing for these in an effort to minimise delay?.

He is obliged to keep his own records.  Clause 4.1 can't be used to fish for information and co-operation would not extend to an obligation by the ER to compensate for the Contractors failure to supply and keep his own records.

- 19.84 Clause 4.3.2 - Where authority limitations are stated in Contract, these are limitations between the ER and Employer in the Conditions of Engagement contract? What is their standing in the Construction Contract Schedule 1?

Their standing is simply to make the Contractor aware of the limitations agreed between the Employer and the ER in his Conditions of Engagement.  This will avoid any possible claim by the Contractor that he was entitled to assume that the ER had all of the powers normally associated with his role and without any restrictions that might result in the Employer's permission being sought for decisions.

- 19.85

What is the breadth of scope of "physically impossible" or "contrary to Legal Requirements", Clause 4.5.4?  Is it the ER's subjective view of an H&amp;S issue?  Is this potentially exploitable under H&amp;S issues?

This might ultimately have to be defined in Arbitration or by a Court in any particular case.  "Physically impossible" doesn't just relate to where the task in question simply cannot be done in any circumstances, It may for instance be possible with unlimited money.  If however, it becomes so unfeasible in that extremely large sums of money has to be thrown at it, it may be regarded as being effectively impossible. It should be noted that Clause 2.4.4 indicates that

<!-- image -->

compliance with the instruction of a PSDP or PSCS does not give rise to an increase in the cost of the contract, or an extension of time.

- 19.86 Clause 4.8.1 - Any Value Engineering proposal cannot increase the Contract Sum.  Does this preclude Client from accepting a beneficial Whole Life Cost proposal, which increased the Contract Sum? Could this be handled by Change Order?

Where the ITT permits variants, and subject to any conditions attaching to such variants being met, it is possible at Tender Stage to accept variants which have a Whole Life Cost advantage. Once the Contract is signed, it is intended that value engineering proposals ought to be confined to reductions in the contract cost, or expediting the date for Substantial Completion.

- 19.87 Under Clause 4.8.2, is it not advisable to have PSCS/PSDP certify that no problem exists as part of considering a value engineering proposal.

It would certainly be advisable to have the PSCS/PSDP involved so that he can be aware of what is proposed, and so that he can agree that the change does not compromise the position on safety, or introduce any issues outside the agreed value engineering proposal. Clause 2.4.4 is now also relevant to this issue.

- 19.88 Where is Employers right to object to a programme?  It is a fait accompli on presentation?

In Clause 4.7, there is a right for the ER to object in writing to any document or proposed course of action submitted by the Contractor as a requirement of the contract.  This would include a programme. If the Employer has specific requirements or restrictions, they should be included in the Works Requirements and any programme submitted should highlight compliance with them.

- 19.89 Does Clause 4.9.2 and 4.9.3 effectively permit Contractor to revise dates for Substantial Completion, or at least set up acceleration issues?

They require him to revise his programme i.e. his intended date for completing the Works when this becomes necessary because of Delay Events etc.  They do no more than provide information to the ER and Employer in relation to the state of progress of the Works at any given point in time.  If the Contractor seeks to use the programme to support claims he will have to formally make the claim under Clause 10 and evidence it etc.

<!-- image -->

19.90

If the Contractor is potentially going to be paid Labour PVC after the Base Date, why is there no provision to check that people are being paid as required under PV1 or PV2?  Clause 5.3.3.A specifically excludes checking this point under that Clause?

Model Form 15 provides that the contractor must certify he is paying according to legal obligations.  He has this obligation in any case.   The PVC provision says what contract relief he will get, and this is a separate issue from his obligation to pay Social Partnership rates, which he is obliged to do.

The PVC provision is a risk valuation and compensation factor, the obligation to pay under Clause 5.3.3(a) is separate and checking compliance with this latter obligation, which is all that the Clause can require.

- 19.91 Under Clause 5.3 is the Contractor obliged to indemnify the Employer against costs incurred by non-compliance?

Clause 5.3.8 says yes, and if the Employer demands payment, it is deductible, ultimately on the Employers Representative decision.

- 19.92 Is there an obligation on Client to ensure that employees are paid up members of Construction Workers Pension Scheme?.  Should it be in Model Form 15?

If a Contractor from abroad is about to start, how can he provide this evidence in response to a Letter of Intent?  He can't do it, therefore, you can't insist on it. Clause 5.3 does insist he does so in future under the Contract.  A Certificate of Intent to do this is permissible, but seeking proof of past compliance is discriminatory.  Compliance with the construction workers pension provisions in a Registered Employment Agreement is what is required during the Contract.

- 19.93 Specialists Clause 5.4 - Clause 5.4.6 appears to give much greater latitude to offer replacements and effectively negates Clause 5.4.5?

Clause 5.4.5 describes circumstances where a Specialist is not to be continued, and Clause 5.4.6 is intended to show how a replacement is to be managed when 5.4.5 is used.

- 19.94 Clause 9.1.2 Before Start Date, does the Employer need sight of Tax Clearance Cert, etc.  Why is this left out of items listed in the SubClause?

These can go into the Letter of Intent under the indicated "catch all" clause at the end.

<!-- image -->

19.95 Clause 9.1.2 - If within 20 days between Start Date and Letter of Acceptance, he fails to provide any of the items listed, what is the position?.

If he doesn't provide the items, he's in breach of contract.  "Shall" under Clause 9.1.2 is quite strict. The Contract entitles the Employer to terminate the Contractor's obligation to complete if he does not remedy the breach within 14 days after receiving a direction to do so.

- 19.96 Clause 10.5 Determination by ER.  If he doesn't respond within time for response, and Contractor has complied with notice provisions, is Claim accepted by default?

No - technically the Employer would be in breach of contract but it is unlikely there would be any loss.  The determination would issue late although it might be the subject of further comment in any dispute resolution process if it arose.

- 19.97 Insurance - Does Clause 10.9 give any comfort to employer who discovers that PI has lapsed and he wishes to insure himself and recover that cost?

It might possibly although such defects are often latent and arise after the Contractor has left the Site. The question to ask is what is your real sanction in this circumstance?  If he's a repeat customer of a repeat client, one might recognise that he is likely to be in business and renewing PI policy (Although any renewal is most unlikely to provide retroactive cover).  Remember a PI policy is primarily to protect the insured.  (This contract does have a right of offset against other contracts with the same Employer).

- 19.98 When would Employer submit a Claim, if he wants to recover money for work not done, does he have to use Clause 10.9?

He should certainly make the claim under Clause 10.9 and give the appropriate notice.  If the omission only came to light after the Final Certificate he could still pursue the Contractor under the Contract.

- 19.99 Clause 10.9.3(2) - Is the Employer potentially doing the calculation related to claims here? The phrase "any contract" could also mean this contract, not necessarily "any other contract".

The Employer would have to do the calculation of the amount due under another contract.  The phrase "under any contract" with a small "c" would not be construed as the Contract with a capital "C"

19.100

Are unforeseen services within a building, and not in the ground, compensation events in Clause 10.10.1.3? of  Minor Works contract?

No they are not Compensation Events as listed in the Schedule part 1K (item 20) as it refers specifically to such services being in the ground.  Accordingly Clause 10.10.1.3 does not apply to them (as it only applies to Compensation Events).

- 19.101 Is there provision for milestone payments in the DB Form of Contract?

Not strictly at present, but Part L could reference milestones in accordance with the Pricing Document, and milestone payments can be identified in the Pricing Document.  Clause 11 as drafted would appear to be capable of accommodating this.

- 19.102 Clause 11.1.1.2 "upon issue of Certificate of Substantial Completion of Works", does (a), (b), (c), (d), not follow from that? Should not (2)(a)(b)(c) and (d) relate to (1) also relate to Interim Payments. Note "at each of the following times".

Yes - it is clear from the wording as set out above that the statement showing the matters at (1)-(4) is required at both interim statements and at Substantial Completion.  There is no time extension for issues arising in an Interim Certificate.  If in doubt, they would not be paid until the following certificate.

- 19.103 The Payment deadline under 11.1.4, taken with the Contractors' powers of suspension under Clause 12.3 and the obligation to check that payment on any application is properly due, all potentially create a highly condensed sequence in time?

The provision of an interim statement starts a time sequence. The ER has to examine the application to comply with his own implied obligations to test it against Clause 11.4, and within 10 working days give a certificate.  The Employer makes a payment within 15 working days of receipt of an invoice.  It should be recalled that working days are referenced rather than calendar days.

19.104 Has "adjudicate" as used in clause 13.1.2 changed the role of the Conciliator?

No - the term "Adjudicate" here is merely used to indicate that the conciliator is to be a competent person to fill that role.

- 19.105 Employer Inspection of Payment records imposes very strict

obligations on Contractor and Specialists.

Other agencies have contracted qualified advisers and they will instruct that service provider to inspect multiple sites on a sample basis for below threshold projects.

- 19.106 Will Met Éireann provide in a timely fashion the statistics needed for the weather event?  Is the description of the weather event precise

enough?

The 10 Year Return Period statistic can be calculated by standard hydrological means from the annual maxima provided as raw data, either by Met Éireann, or by the user.

What is the practical means of assessment of "Expenses unavoidably incurred by Contractor?"

19.107

ER would have to assess this on submission by the contractor. No forensic scrutiny of records is implied and you can't trawl using other inspection powers under the Contract.  Presumably the Contractor would be happy to co-operate on such a matter.

19.108 If you request a proposal, but do not proceed with it, can you pay the Contractor to prepare the proposal?

No

19.109 Health &amp; Safety - What happens with initial PSDP in a DB?  Does each tenderer have to have a PSDP in preparing his bid?

A similar question arises for the Employer in that the Employer's experts including the ER will be assessing the tenders and indeed may have initiated the design process by an indicative design or Employer's Requirements.  It might therefore be more appropriate that the Employer appoints initially and then passes on that role to the Contractor upon his appointment.

19.110

What of a train of conciliators recommendations, with a total amount of money deemed unacceptable by the Employer?  The clause as phrased appears to require that the Conciliator shall not be an Arbitrator?

The provisions of the Contract would apply to each and every recommendation of the conciliator. It is intended that he not act as an arbitrator in resolving the dispute - thus, his role is to facilitate the parties in structured negotiations leading hopefully to an amicable resolution of the matters at issue.  It is also intended that he should not be "the arbitrator" under this Contract.

<!-- image -->

- 19.111 How do you know when you are in dispute?

If either party notifies to this effect, but there are cases where occurrence   of dispute is itself a matter for decision.  However the problem rarely arises as parties generally know when a dispute has arisen.

- 19.112 If appointing body is used, will it be their rules?

Conciliation rules are in the Contract and the Dept. of Finance have developed Arbitration Rules, which apply.

- 19.113 Definition of "Site" very wide, so how does it affect "unfixed works items".

The definition of Site is clear enough so as to avoid confusion in most cases as to whether Works Items are in fact on or off of the Site.

- 19.114 The Conciliators' Award Bond, where does its cost lie if Arbitrator finds the conciliation award was in fact correct?

It is likely that it will have to be borne by the party providing the bond. However, the party has a choice as to whether he wishes to provide the bond or not.  It is likely that the choice would be to provide the bond in view of the fact that he is getting payment.  It might possibly be claimable in the arbitration proceedings in the event that a final award had not been made at the relevant stage.

- 19.115 Can you insist on having the Safety File before issuing a Certificate of Substantial Completion?

It is the PSDP who is responsible for the Safety File under the new Regulations, but if the Contractor has not handed over essential  material for the PSDP to include in the Safety File, it would be a valid reason for giving reasons to withhold the Certificate.  Otherwise, the Employer would be in control of an As-Constructed Asset for which he didn't have a Safety File.

- 19.116 Hyperinflation - Is there an entitlement for hyperinflation for subsequent months after the hyperinflation month?

No, there is no continuing relief if the index stays high.

- 19.117 Should there be a requirement to nominate a Temporary Works Designer as a Specialist in order to clarify role of PSDP related to these?  Can this be included in the Works Requirements?

This is a matter for Contracting Authorities to decide.

<!-- image -->

Why no sectional completion in the Minor Works Form?  Very many minor projects involve extensions, followed by decanting to the new

- 19.118 area, with refurbishment of the old.

This has been taken under consideration.  There is no impediment to inclusion of a programming constraint in the Works Requirements to cover this situation.

19.119 Is it necessary to include the Model Form of Parent Company Guarantee in Pre-Qual document as an indication of the guarantee which will be required prior to any Contract?

It is worthwhile including the Model form as an indication of the requirement if a Parent Company Guarantee is relied upon, and in general references to "Model forms" should be clarified as referring to the Department of Finance Model Forms.

- 19.120 With respect to Unfixed Work Items in Interim Payments, and Clause 11.2.  Can there be a formal Vesting Certificate drafted for use by the Contractor?

This has been taken under consideration.

- 19.121 In relation to Asbestos, what precisely is the guidance on it?

Delete the exclusion if you suspect you may encounter it.  This is so that insurance for asbestos is required.  As "ordinary" contractors will normally not deal with asbestos and will not have insurance cover for it, the Contract is likely to use a Specialist who will be qualified to handle it.  However as the Contract stands - the Contractor will have to provide insurance cover.

- 19.122 Are we looking for Contract-specific insurance now if the parties have to be co-insured?

The practical implication is that there will be a schedule of co-insured parties attaching to the Contractors insurances and changing from time to time.

19.123 There's a different Base Date for PV1 than PV2, what is the explanation?

PV1.1.1(a) p76

Base Date = 31st month after Contract Date

PV2 Appendix No. 1 p82(d)

Base date = 37th calendar month after Designated date.

Under PV1 if you sign up, and you take longer than 6 months to get the contract signed, no extra disadvantage occurs to the Employer.  Same effect really, but some disadvantage to Employer in PV2, in that he has 36 months from the Designated Date, so that slippage in signing up eats into his fixed price period. Guidance Note Section 2.5.2 explains the position.

Does the definition of "Site" potentially designate the Contractors fabrication yard as part of the Site, thereby essentially neutralising the provisions governing payment for materials fabricated but not

- 19.124 fixed in the Works?

The definition would not include the fabrication yards unless they were stated to be so in the Contract as a place where the Works are to be executed or are identified as the Site in the Works Requirements.

- 19.125 If in law you hold money that might belong to a subcontractor at some remove, is there a vulnerability to suit?

It is possible but the Employer is only likely to withhold such money from the Contractor because the Contractor has not paid it.  Ultimately the Employer could end up holding money owed to another entity but presumably the intention would be to pay it over subject to satisfactory proof etc.

- 19.126 Residual Risk in a Defects Period?  What if Employer puts a high value on the residual risk and is it possible the monies withheld might exceed value for remedying the defect?

If you cannot extend Defects period on an item that was repaired, and you withhold money, and you methodically set out how you calculate your exposure, it is more difficult to challenge it as a penalty.  The more intangible the value elements, the less defensible that would be.

- 19.127 Collateral warranty, when the Specialist is a designer, is there a potential tension arising from the fitness for purpose obligation of the Contractor?

The obligation of reasonable skill and care is what is stated in the Conditions of Engagement and it would be unfair of Contracting Authority to attempt to impose any higher standard via collateral warranty.  There is a tension, the collateral warranty highlights it. Where an Employer has engaged a Consultant, under the COE and novated him, under the COE its liability is "reasonable skill and care".

- 19.128 Could it happen that, in the Collateral Warranty, the access to the Specialist is not as comprehensive as Employer assumed, because contract between Contractor and Specialist may not cover what Employer thought it did?

The plan is that the Employer will not concern itself with the contract between the Contractor and the Specialist as the Contractor is fully liable for the Specialist's work (including design).

19.129

The limitations on the ER will be known to Contractor, if the ER exceeds them, is the Contractor protected?  If the ER is replaced and Employer acts in that role, can the position be free of bias?

Contractor has protection of the Contract and does not need to look behind ER authority limits.

- 19.130 In absence of Framework Agreements, what would be the lowest value for use in the Minor Works?

There is no lower limit it is €5m down to zero.
